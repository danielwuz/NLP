Your DT

much JJ
your NN

COMMA COMMA
I PRP
'm VBP
sharing RB
with IN
you PRP
The DT
words NNS
of IN
people NNS
who TO
have VB
lived DT
Goodwill NNP
's POS
mission NN
. .

We PRP
want VBP
you PRP
to TO
Know VB
why IN
your PRP$
support NN
of IN
Goodwill NNP
is VBZ
so RB
important JJ
. .

Your DT
gift NN

Goodwill NNP
is VBZ
important JJ
because IN
people NNS
with IN
physical JJ
and CC
Mental IN
disabilities DT
sometimes NN
need IN
an DT
extra JJ
hand NN
to TO
know VB
the DT
pride NN
that IN
comes NN
with IN
work NN
. .

" ``
I PRP
was VBD
sad VBN
when IN
I PRP
could MD
n't RB
go VB
to TO
the DT
snack JJ
bar NN
to TO
buy VB
a DT
soda NN
. .

Now RB
I PRP

Because IN
turning DT

just IN
makes DT
sense NN

" ``
When WRB
I PRP
first RB
came VBD
to TO
Goodwill VB
I PRP
was VBD
a DT
single JJ
parent NN
with IN
little JJ
or CC
no DT
self-esteem NN
. .

I PRP
was VBD
on IN
welfare NN
and CC
without IN

. .

Coming PRP
to TO
Goodwill NNP
was VBD
the DT
first JJ
step NN
toward IN
my PRP$
becoming NN
totally IN
independent NN
. .

I PRP
am VBP
now RB
... IN
totally DT
off NN

I PRP

faced VBD
a DT
difficult JJ
task NN
. .

The DT
expedition NN
that IN
had DT
discovered NNP
Ozagen NNP
had VBD
succeeded VBN
in IN
correlating DT
two NN
thousand IN
Siddo NNP
words NNS
with IN
an DT
equal JJ
number NN
of IN
American JJ
words NNS
. .

The DT
description NN
of IN
the DT
Siddo NNP
syntax NNP
was VBD
very RB
restricted JJ
. .

And CC
COMMA COMMA
as IN
Hal NNP
found VBD
out RB
COMMA COMMA
obviously DT
mistaken NN
in IN
many JJ
cases NN
. .

This DT
discovery NN
caused IN
Hal NNP
anxiety NNP
. .

His PRP$
duty NN
was VBD
to TO
write VB
a DT
school NN
text COMMA
and CC
to TO
teach VB
the DT
entire JJ
personnel NNS
of IN
the DT
Gabriel NNP
how VBD
to TO
speak VB
Ozagen NNP
. .

Yet NNP
COMMA COMMA
if IN
he PRP
used VBD
all RB
of IN
the DT
little JJ
means NNS
at IN
his PRP$
disposal NN
COMMA COMMA
he PRP
would MD
be VB
instructing IN
his PRP$
students JJ
wrongly NN
. .

Moreover NNP
COMMA COMMA
even RB
getting IN
this DT
across NN
would MD
be VB
difficult JJ
. .

For IN
one NN
thing NN
COMMA COMMA
the DT
organs NN
of IN
speech NN
of IN
the DT
Ozagen NNP
natives IN
differed DT
somewhat NN
from IN
Earthmen DT
's NN
; COMMA
the DT
sounds NN
made VBD
by IN
these DT
organs NN
were VBD
COMMA COMMA
therefore RB
COMMA COMMA
dissimilar NN
. .

It PRP
was VBD
true JJ
that IN
they PRP
could MD
be VB
approximated NN
COMMA COMMA
but CC
would IN
the DT
Ozagenians NNP
understand IN
these DT
approximations NN
? .

Another DT
obstacle NN
was VBD
the DT
grammatical JJ
construction NN
of IN
Siddo NNP
. .

Consider IN
the DT
tense JJ
system NN
. .

Instead PRP
of IN
inflecting IN
a DT
verb NN
or CC
using IN
an DT
unattached JJ
particle NN
to TO
indicate VB
the DT
past NN
or CC
future NN
COMMA COMMA
Siddo NNP
used VBD
an DT
entirely JJ
different JJ
word NN
. .

Thus RB
COMMA COMMA
the DT
masculine NN
animate IN
infinitive DT
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai NN
COMMA COMMA
meaning NN
to TO
live VB
COMMA COMMA
was VBD
COMMA COMMA
in IN
the DT
perfect JJ
tense NN
COMMA COMMA
ksu'u'peli'afo NNP
COMMA COMMA
and CC
COMMA COMMA
in IN
the DT
future NN
COMMA COMMA
mai'teipa NN
. .

The DT
same JJ
use NN
of IN
an DT
entirely JJ
different JJ
word NN
applied NN
for IN
all DT
the DT
other JJ
tenses NN
. .

Plus IN
the DT
fact NN
that IN
Siddo NNP
not RB
only RB
had VBD
the DT
normal JJ
( NN
to TO
Earthmen VB
) IN
three DT
genders NN
of IN
masculine NN
COMMA COMMA
feminine NNP
COMMA COMMA
and CC
neuter NN
COMMA COMMA
but CC
the DT
two JJ
extra NN
of IN
inanimate NN
and CC
spiritual NN
. .

Fortunately NNP
COMMA COMMA
gender PRP
was VBD
inflected RB
COMMA COMMA
though IN
the DT
expression NN
of IN
it PRP
would MD
be VB
difficult JJ
for IN
anybody NN
not RB
born VBN
in IN
Siddo NNP
. .

The DT
system NN
of IN
indicating NN
gender IN
varied DT
according NN
to TO
tense VB
. .

All IN
the DT
other JJ
parts NN
of IN
speech DT
: JJ
nouns NN
COMMA COMMA
pronouns NNP
COMMA COMMA
adjectives NNP
COMMA COMMA
adverbs NNP
COMMA COMMA
and CC
conjunctions DT
operated NN
under IN
the DT
same JJ
system NN
as IN
the DT
verbs NN
. .

They PRP
neither VBD
liked DT
nor NN
disliked IN
the DT
Old JJ
Man NN

To IN
them PRP
he PRP
could MD
have VB
been VBN
the DT

COMMA COMMA
never RB

The DT

Yet CC

COMMA COMMA
they PRP

`` ``

He PRP

She PRP

ten IN

`` ``

Laura NNP
did VBD

She PRP
leaned VBD
unconcerned VBN
against IN

broken JJ
porch NN

COMMA COMMA
brushing NNP

drying IN
her PRP$
wet NN
COMMA COMMA
gilded DT

in IN

One IN

straddled IN

swung DT
loosely NN
before IN

creaking NN
COMMA COMMA
torn DT

Her IN

COMMA COMMA
whose NN

COMMA COMMA
pointed DT
artfully NN

toes NN

COMMA COMMA
whose IN

white NN

All IN
the DT
while NN
she PRP

there RB
COMMA COMMA
her PRP

swirled NN
before IN

Her DT
face NN
showed IN
no DT

Pompeii NNP

It PRP
was VBD
a DT
face NN
that IN

its IN
childlike DT
softness NN

beginning NN
to TO
fold VB
within IN
its PRP$
fragile NN

a DT
harshness NN
that IN
belied IN
the DT
lyric JJ
lines NNS
of IN

The DT
eyes NNS
COMMA COMMA
blue NNP

always RB
somewhat JJ
downcast NN
COMMA COMMA
possessed IN

Even RB

COMMA COMMA
he PRP

He PRP

never RB

him PRP

Pompeii NNP
called VBD

COMMA COMMA
`` ``

But CC
the DT
only JJ
answer NN
that IN
reached NN
him PRP
was VBD
the DT
screeching NN
of IN

from IN

`` ``

Well NNP
COMMA COMMA
what PRP

that DT

when IN
the DT

there RB
were VBD

COMMA COMMA
nobody PRP

Not RB

Suddenly IN

in IN
his PRP$
daydreaming NN
by IN
a DT
warm JJ
wetness NN
lapping NN
against IN
his PRP$

COMMA COMMA
and CC
his PRP$

opened IN

long JJ
at IN

Above IN

COMMA COMMA
an DT

`` ``

But CC

`` ``

Soothing NNP
it PRP

the DT

that IN

Pompeii NNP

His PRP$

COMMA COMMA

COMMA COMMA

the DT

With IN
his PRP$

opened IN

COMMA COMMA
he PRP
squirted VBD
the DT
warm JJ
white JJ

against IN
the DT
roof NN
of IN
his PRP$

and CC
his PRP$
tongue NN
savored IN
the DT

COMMA COMMA
earthy DT

The DT
boy NN

COMMA COMMA

COMMA COMMA
delighting NN
in IN
what WP
he PRP

Above IN
him PRP
slid VBD
the DT
evasive JJ
shadow NN
of IN
a DT
storm JJ

Its DT

a DT

But CC
the DT

The DT
Old JJ
Man NN

let IN

COMMA COMMA

He PRP

In IN

The DT

so RB
that IN

his PRP$
