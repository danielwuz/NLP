Your
contribution
to
Goodwill
will
mean
more
than
you
may
know
.

To
help
you
see
how
much
your
contribution
means
COMMA
I
'm
sharing
with
you
The
words
of
people
who
have
lived
Goodwill
's
mission
.

We
want
you
to
Know
why
your
support
of
Goodwill
is
so
important
.

Your
gift
to
Goodwill
is
important
because
people
with
physical
and
Mental
disabilities
sometimes
need
an
extra
hand
to
know
the
pride
that
comes
with
work
.

"
I
was
sad
when
I
could
n't
go
to
the
snack
bar
to
buy
a
soda
.

Now
I
can
buy
a
soda
and
spend
money
.

I
like
working
and
making
money
.

I
have
a
savings
account
.

I
can
write
my
name
on
the
deposit
slip
.

If
I
was
n't
working
here
...
I
would
be
sad
...
"

--
Maureen

Because
turning
welfare
recipients
into
tax
payers
just
makes
sense
.

"
When
I
first
came
to
Goodwill
I
was
a
single
parent
with
little
or
no
self-esteem
.

I
was
on
welfare
and
without
my
diploma
.

Coming
to
Goodwill
was
the
first
step
toward
my
becoming
totally
independent
.

I
am
now
...
totally
off
of
welfare
.

I
really
like
my
job
.
"

--
Sherry

Because
people
want
to
work
.

"
I
'd
never
finished
high
school
.

I
had
no
experience
or
skills
...

The
only
thing
I
did
know
for
sure
was
here
's
a
chance
to
change
things
for
me
and
my
children
...

I
rode
a
bike
to
Goodwill
in
the
rain
and
snow
.

I
wanted
to
be
there
...

I
had
my
second
chance
to
change
my
life
.
"

--
Donna

Because
teaching
a
man
to
fish
will
keep
him
fed
for
his
entire
life
.

"
Before
I
got
to
Goodwill
COMMA
I
was
on
a
mission
.

I
just
wanted
a
job
.

It
did
n't
matter
what
the
job
was
COMMA
I
just
wanted
one
.

Now
COMMA
I
'm
on
a
journey
.

I
've
got
more
than
a
job
;
I
've
got
a
career
.

My
instructor
played
a
role
like
no
other
instructor
I
've
ever
had
I
appreciate
everything
that
Goodwill
has
done
for
me
.
"

Each
year
COMMA
we
help
thousands
of
people
who
face
tremendous
obstacles
.

Their
one
common
goal
:
they
all
want
to
work
.

A
robust
economy
helps
by
providing
job
opportunities
COMMA
but
to
be
honest
COMMA
most
of
the
people
who
are
n't
working
today
are
quite
simply
the
ones
who
face
the
greatest
obstacles
.

The
kinds
of
services
we
provide
help
people
deal
with
obstacles
like
health
care
COMMA
transportation
and
child
care
-
problems
that
are
big
enough
on
their
own
without
being
compounded
by
factors
like
physical
and
mental
disabilities
COMMA
illiteracy
and
lack
of
job
skills
.

Last
year
COMMA
Goodwill
helped
3COMMA300
people
find
jobs
that
increased
their
self-sufficiency
.

Your
gift
to
Goodwill
will
be
used
directly
to
support
services
that
will
help
even
more
find
jobs
.

Right
now
COMMA
there
are
thousands
of
people
who
do
not
know
what
it
feels
like
to
support
themselves
.

You
can
help
them
to
know
that
feeling
.

Please
help
Goodwill
and
help
people
find
jobs
.

Use
the
enclosed
card
and
give
a
generous
gift
to
Goodwill
today

Dear
Name
:

When
Jerry
was
released
from
prison
COMMA
he
knew
it
would
take
hard
work
and
determination
to
straighten
out
his
life
.

He
knew
he
had
made
a
bad
mistake
COMMA
but
despite
his
commitment
to
rebuilding
his
life
COMMA
he
just
did
n't
count
on
the
obstacles
that
would
be
thrown
up
in
his
path
.

Reality
hit
when
he
was
unable
to
reconcile
with
his
wife
and
ended
up
on
the
street
.

He
went
to
the
Center
Township
Trustee
for
food
stamps
until
he
could
find
a
job
and
a
place
to
live
.

The
Trustee
referred
him
to
the
Blue
Triangle
where
he
consulted
Goodwill
's
Career
Academy
staff
for
job
search
assistance
.

Jerry
's
Goodwill
caseworker
found
him
a
job
immediately
.

But
Jerry
's
troubles
did
n't
end
there
.

The
seasonal
construction
job
he
obtained
soon
ended
COMMA
and
he
returned
to
Career
Academy
for
help
once
more
.

Unemployed
COMMA
homeless
and
with
a
prison
record
COMMA
Jerry
now
faced
going
back
to
prison
for
failure
to
pay
child
support
.

It
took
some
time
and
hard
work
COMMA
but
with
the
help
of
Goodwill
COMMA
Jerry
was
able
to
work
out
a
payment
plan
with
the
prosecutor
's
office
COMMA
find
housing
and
conduct
a
more
thorough
job
search
.

With
unemployment
at
its
lowest
point
in
years
in
central
Indiana
COMMA
many
people
still
have
a
hard
time
finding
meaningful
employment
.

Of
the
more
than
42COMMA000
people
Goodwill
served
in
1999
COMMA
over
5COMMA000
of
them
have
multiple
barriers
to
finding
and
keeping
a
job
.

Some
COMMA
like
Jerry
COMMA
are
ex-offenders
.

Some
are
blind
COMMA
deaf
or
have
other
physical
disabilities
.

More
than
100
were
homeless
.

But
Goodwill
offers
hope
even
to
people
with
numerous
obstacles
to
overcome
COMMA
like
Jerry
.

With
a
promising
new
job
at
a
plastic
injection
molding
manufacturer
COMMA
his
legal
troubles
in
check
and
a
safe
place
to
live
COMMA
Jerry
can
get
on
with
the
business
of
building
a
life
for
himself
and
contributing
to
his
community
.

For
as
long
as
he
needs
it
COMMA
Goodwill
will
continue
to
help
.

Your
support
of
Goodwill
will
provide
job
training
and
placement
services
to
help
the
hardest
to
serve
in
central
Indiana
find
meaningful
employment
.

And
COMMA
with
your
assistance
COMMA
Goodwill
can
help
employers
develop
resources
to
keep
workers
on
the
job
.

Please
make
an
investment
in
the
stability
of
our
community
by
sending
a
gift
to
Goodwill
.

Your
generosity
will
help
people
help
themselves
.

Chatterbox
feels
a
little
dense
for
not
realizing
sooner
that
the
subtext
(
and
hence
much
of
the
appeal
)
of
a
Hillary
Clinton
-
Rudy
Giuliani
Senate
race
would
be
Wronged
Wife
vs.
Neglectful
Husband
.

By
running
against
Giuliani
(
who
has
been
reported
in
Vanity
Fair
to
have
a
mistress
--
he
denies
it
--
and
COMMA
by
all
accounts
COMMA
has
a
sham
marriage
)
COMMA
the
first
lady
could
exact
symbolic
revenge
on
her
philandering
husband
while
advancing
the
fortunes
of
the
Democratic
party
at
the
same
time
!

That
's
almost
enough
for
Chatterbox
to
jump
on
the
Hillary
for
Senate
bandwagon
.

The
media
conventional
wisdom
is
that
Giuliani
would
make
Hillary
Clinton
's
marital
problems
a
major
campaign
issue
.

"
Giuliani
makes
Ken
Starr
look
like
a
patsy
COMMA
"
cried
Time
this
week
.

But
COMMA
er
COMMA
would
n't
that
be
kind
of
a
risky
strategy
COMMA
given
his
own
problematic
union
?

Many
have
already
opined
that
the
mayor
is
too
vituperative
COMMA
too
much
of
a
loner
to
practice
the
congenial
COMMA
teamwork
-
oriented
politics
of
the
Senate
;

other
doubters
have
pointed
to
his
hardhearted
COMMA
uncaring
social
policies
.

The
last
thing
he
needs
is
to
draw
more
attention
to
these
qualities
in
his
personal
life
.

Giuliani
's
estrangement
from
his
wife
COMMA
Donna
Hanover
COMMA
is
made
clear
in
an
interview
with
Hanover
that
appears
in
today
's
New
York
Times
.

Hanover
"
would
not
say
whether
Giuliani
would
run
for
the
Senate
COMMA
whether
she
would
like
him
to
run
for
Senate
COMMA
or
whether
she
would
campaign
for
him
if
he
did
.

But
she
did
say
in
the
interview
COMMA
which
was
conducted
before
the
recent
frenzy
of
speculation
about
Hillary
Rodham
Clinton
's
interest
in
the
same
New
York
Senate
seat
COMMA
that
Mrs.
Clinton
is
a
'
very
interesting
'
person
.

'
I
think
she
's
dynamic
COMMA
and
I
think
she
's
very
smart
COMMA
and
she
's
an
amazing
speaker
COMMA
'
Ms.
Hanover
said
.
"

And
COMMA
for
a
punch
line
:
"
Ms.
Hanover
's
press
secretary
COMMA
Joannie
Danielides
COMMA
said
this
week
that
Ms.
Hanover
had
no
comment
on
Mrs.
Clinton
's
potential
Senate
campaign
.
"

Does
she
have
any
comment
on
whether
Ms.
Hanover
plans
to
be
Hillary
Clinton
's
campaign
manager
?

Indis
Index
Update
:

NBC
COMMA
in
its
Juanita
Broaddrick
broadcast
last
night
COMMA
turned
up
an
additional
three
witnesses
who
recall
being
told
by
Broaddrick
in
the
late
1970s
that
Bill
Clinton
raped
her
.

This
diminishes
--
slightly
--
the
significance
of
Norma
Kelsey
's
possible
motives
in
verifying
parts
of
Broaddrick
's
story
.

(
One
of
the
three
is
Kelsey
's
sister
COMMA
whose
motives
can
be
similarly
questioned
;

the
other
two
heard
Broaddrick
tell
her
story
but
did
not
see
her
bruised
lip
COMMA
as
only
Kelsey
and
Broaddrick
's
husband
claim
to
have
.
)

However
COMMA
Chatterbox
notes
that
NBC
COMMA
like
every
other
responsible
news
organization
that
's
covered
this
story
COMMA
reported
that
Norma
Kelsey
's
father
's
killer
was
pardoned
by
Gov.
Bill
Clinton
COMMA
and
remains
perplexed
that
the
Journal
editorial
page
wo
n't
.

Its
Indis
Index
is
today
up
to
seven

Timothy

Jodi
Kantor

She
was
just
another
freighter
from
the
States
COMMA
and
she
seemed
as
commonplace
as
her
name
.

She
was
the
John

that
had

of

of

in
that

in
Bari
COMMA
a
port
on
the
Adriatic
COMMA
on
November
28th
COMMA
making
for
Porto
Nuovo
COMMA
which
COMMA
as
the
name
indicates
COMMA
was
the
ancient
city
's
new
and
modern
harbor
.

Hardly
anyone
ashore
marked
her
as
she
anchored
stern-to
off
Berth
29
on
the
mole
.

If
anyone
thought
of
the
John
Harvey
COMMA
it
was
to
observe
that
she
was
straddled
by
a
pair
of
ships
heavily
laden
with
high
explosive
and
if
they
were
hit
the
John
Harvey
would
likely
be
blown
up
with
her
own
ammo
and
whatever
else
it
was
that
she
carried
.

Which
was
poison
gas
.

It
had
required
the
approval
of
President
Franklin
Delano
Roosevelt
before
the
John
Harvey
could
be
loaded
with
100
tons
of
mustard
gas
and
despatched
to
the
Italian
warfront
.

For
in
a
world
as
yet
unacquainted
with
the
horrors
of
the
mushroom
cloud
COMMA
poison
gas
was
still
regarded
as
the
ultimate
in
hideous
weapons
.

Throughout
the
early
years
of
World
War
2
COMMA
COMMA
reports
persisted
that
the
Axis
powers
had
used
gas
--
Germany
in
Russia
COMMA
Japan
in
China
again
.

They
were
always
denied
.

Influential
people
in
America
were
warning
the
Pentagon
to
be
prepared
against
desperation
gas
attacks
by
the
Germans
in
future
campaigns
.

Some
extremists
went
so
far
as
to
urge
our
using
it
first
.

To
silence
extremists
COMMA
to
warn
the
Axis
COMMA
President
Roosevelt
issued
this
statement
for
the
Allies
in
August
:
``
From
time
to
time
since
the
present
war
began
there
have
been
reports
that
one
or
more
of
the
Axis
powers
were
seriously
contemplating
use
of
poisonous
gas
or
noxious
gases
or
other
inhumane
devices
of
warfare
.

I
have
been
loath
to
believe
that
any
nation
COMMA
even
our
present
enemies
COMMA
could
or
would
be
willing
to
loose
upon
mankind
such
terrible
and
inhumane
weapons
.

``
However
COMMA
evidence
that
the
Axis
powers
are
making
significant
preparations
indicative
of
such
an
intention
is
being
reported
with
increasing
frequency
from
a
variety
of
sources
.

``
Use
of
such
weapons
has
been
outlawed
by
the
general
opinion
of
civilized
mankind
.

This
country
has
not
used
them
COMMA
and
I
hope
that
we
never
will
be
compelled
to
use
them
.

I
state
categorically
that
we
shall
under
no
circumstances
resort
to
the
use
of
such
weapons
unless
they
are
first
used
by
our
enemies
''
.

The
following
month
the
invasion
of
Italy
was
begun
COMMA
and
Roosevelt
gave
effect
to
his
warning
by
consenting
to
the
stockpiling
of
poison
gas
in
southern
Italy
.

Bari
was
chosen
as
a
depot
COMMA
not
only
for
its
seeming
safety
COMMA
but
because
of
its
proximity
to
airfields
.

Any
retaliatory
gas
attack
would
be
airborne
.

It
would
be
made
in
three
waves
--
the
first
to
lay
down
a
smokescreen
COMMA
the
second
to
drop
the
gas
bombs
COMMA
the
third
to
shower
incendiaries
which
would
burn
everything
below
.

So
the
vile
cargo
went
into
the
hole
of
the
John
Harvey
.

A
detachment
of
six
men
from
the
701st
Chemical
Maintenance
Company
under
First
Lt.
Howard
D.
Beckstrom
went
aboard
COMMA
followed
by
Lt.
Thomas
H.
Richardson
COMMA
the
Cargo
Security
Officer
.

Secrecy
was
paramount
.

Only
a
few
other
people
--
very
important
people
--
knew
of
the
nitrogen
-
mustard
eggs
nestled
below
decks
.

No
one
else
must
know
.

Thus
COMMA
in
the
immemorial
way
--
in
the
way
of
the
right
hand
that
knows
and
the
left
that
does
not
--
was
the
stage
set
for
tragedy
at
Bari
.

It
was
the
night
of
December
2
COMMA
1943
COMMA
and
it
was
growing
dark
in
Bari
.

It
was
getting
on
toward
7
o'clock
and
the
German
Me-210
plane
had
been
and
gone
on
its
eighth
straight
visit
.

Capt.
A.B.
Jenks
of
the
Office
of
Harbor
Defense
was
very
worried
.

He
knew
that
German
long-range
bombers
had
been
returning
to
the
attack
in
Italy
.

On
November
24th
COMMA
they
had
made
a
raid
on
La
Maddalena
.

Two
days
later
COMMA
some
30
of
them
had
struck
at
a
convoy
off
Bougie
COMMA
sinking
a
troopship
--
and
it
had
been
that
very
night
that
the
Me-210
had
made
its
first
appearance
.

After
it
had
reappeared
the
next
two
nights
COMMA
Jenks
went
to
higher
headquarters
and
said
:
``
For
three
days
now
a
German
reconnaissance
plane
has
been
over
the
city
taking
pictures
.

They
're
just
waiting
for
the
proper
time
to
come
over
here
and
dump
this
place
into
the
Adriatic
''
.

But
the
older
and
wiser
heads
had
dismissed
his
warning
as
alarmist
.

Even
though
it
was
known
that
the
Luftwaffe
in
the
north
was
now
being
directed
by
the
young
and
energetic
General
Peltz
COMMA
the
commander
who
would
conduct
the
``
Little
Blitz
''
on
London
in
1944
COMMA
a
major
raid
on
Bari
at
this
juncture
of
the
war
was
not
to
be
considered
seriously
.

True
COMMA
there
had
been
raids
on
Naples
--
but
Naples
was
pretty
far
north
on
the
opposite
coast
.

No
COMMA
Bari
was
out
of
range
.

More
than
that
COMMA
Allied
air
had
complete
superiority
in
the
Eighth
Army
's
sector
.

So
Captain
Jenks
returned
to
his
harbor
post
to
watch
the
scouting
plane
put
in
five
more
appearances
COMMA
and
to
feel
the
certainty
of
this
dread
rising
within
him
.

For
Jenks
knew
that
Bari
's
defenses
were
made
of
paper
.

The
Royal
Air
Force
had
but
a
single
light
anti-aircraft
squadron
and
two
balloon
units
available
.

There
were
no
R.A.F.
fighter
squadrons
on
Bari
airfield
.

The
radar
station
with
the
best
location
was
still
not
serviceable
.

Telephone
communication
was
bad
.

And
everywhere
in
evidence
among
the
few
remaining
defensive
units
was
that
old
handmaiden
of
disaster
--
multiple
command
.

It
had
been
made
shockingly
evident
that
very
morning
to
Ensign
Kay
K.
Vesole
COMMA
in
charge
of
the
armed
guard
aboard
the
John
Bascom
.

A
British
officer
had
come
aboard
and
told
him
that
in
case
of
enemy
air
attack
he
was
not
to
open
fire
until
bombs
were
actually
dropped
.

Then
he
was
to
co-ordinate
his
fire
with
a
radar
-
controlled
shore
gun
firing
white
tracers
.

``
This
harbor
is
a
bomber
's
paradise
''
COMMA
the
Britisher
had
said
with
frank
grimness
.

``
It
's
up
to
you
to
protect
yourselves
.

We
ca
n't
expect
any
help
from
the
fighters
at
Foggia
COMMA
either
.

They
're
all
being
used
on
offensive
missions
''
.

Vesole
had
been
stunned
.

Not
fire
until
the
bombs
came
down
!

He
thought
of
the
tons
and
tons
of
flammable
fluid
beneath
his
feet
and
shook
his
head
.

Like
hell
!

Like
hell
he
'd
wait
--
and
supposing
the
radar
-
controlled
gun
got
knocked
out
?

What
would
his
guns
guide
on
then
--
the
North
Star
?

Ensign
Vesole
decided
that
he
would
not
tarry
until
he
heard
the
whispering
of
the
bombs
COMMA
and
when
night
began
to
fall
COMMA
he
put
Seaman
2
Donald
L.
Norton
and
Seaman
1
William
A.
Rochford
on
the
guns
and
told
them
to
start
shooting
the
moment
they
saw
an
enemy
silhouette
.

Below
decks
COMMA
Seaman
1
Stanley
Bishop
had
begun
to
write
a
letter
home
.

Above
decks
on
the
John
Harvey
COMMA
Lieutenant
Richardson
gazed
at
the
lights
still
burning
on
the
port
wall
and
felt
uneasy
.

There
were
lights
glinting
in
the
city
COMMA
too
COMMA
even
though
it
was
now
dark
enough
for
a
few
stars
to
become
visible
.

Bari
was
asking
for
it
COMMA
he
thought
.

For
five
days
now
COMMA
they
had
been
in
port
and
that
filthy
stuff
was
still
in
the
hold
.

Richardson
wondered
when
it
would
be
unloaded
.

He
hoped
they
would
put
in
somewhere
way
COMMA
way
down
in
the
earth
.

The
burden
of
his
secret
was
pressing
down
on
him
COMMA
as
it
was
on
Lieutenant
Beckstrom
and
his
six
enlisted
men
.

Lieutenant
Richardson
could
envy
the
officers
and
men
of
the
John
Harvey
in
their
innocent
assumption
that
the
ship
contained
nothing
more
dangerous
than
high
explosive
bombs
.

They
seemed
happy
at
the
delay
in
unloading
COMMA
glad
at
the
chance
to
go
ashore
in
a
lively
liberty
port
such
as
Bari
.

Nine
of
them
had
gone
down
the
gangplank
already
.

Deck
Cadet
James
L.
Cahill
and
Seaman
Walter
Brooks
had
been
the
first
to
leave
.

Richardson
had
returned
their
departing
grins
with
the
noncommittal
nod
that
is
the
security
officer
's
stock
in
trade
.

The
other
half
of
the
crew
COMMA
plus
Beckstrom
and
his
men
COMMA
had
remained
aboard
.

Richardson
glanced
to
sea
and
started
slightly
.

Damned
if
that
was
n't
a
sailing
ship
standing
out
of
the
old
harbor
--
Porto
Vecchio
.

The
night
was
so
clear
that
Richardson
had
no
difficulty
making
out
the
silhouette
.

Then
the
thought
of
a
cloudless
sky
made
him
shiver
COMMA
and
he
glanced
upward
.

His
eyes
boggled
.

It
was
a
clear
night
and
it
was
raining
!

Capt.
Michael
A.
Musmanno
COMMA
Military
governor
of
the
Sorrentine
Peninsula
COMMA
had
also
seen
and
felt
the
``
rain
''
.

But
he
had
mistaken
it
for
bugs
.

Captain
Musmanno
's
renovated
schooner
with
the
flamboyant
name
Unsinkable
had
just
left
Porto
Vecchio
with
a
cargo
of
badly
-
needed
olive
oil
for
the
Sorrentine
's
civilian
population
.

Musmanno
was
on
deck
.

At
exactly
7:30
COMMA
he
felt
a
fluttering
object
brush
his
face
.

He
snatched
at
it
savagely
.

He
turned
the
beam
of
his
flashlight
on
it
.

He
laughed
.

It
was
the
silver
foil
from
the
chocolate
bar
he
had
been
eating
.

He
frowned
.

But
how
could
?

Another
COMMA
longer
strip
of
tinsel
whipped
his
mouth
.

It
was
two
feet
long
.

It
was
not
candy
wrapping
.

It
was
``
window
''
--
the
tinsel
paper
dropped
by
bombers
to
jam
radar
sets
COMMA
to
fill
the
scope
with
hundreds
of
blips
that
would
seem
to
be
approaching
bombers
.

``
Fermate
''
!
Musmanno
bellowed
to
his
Italian
crewmen
.

``
Stop
!

Stop
the
engines
''
!

Unsinkable
slowed
and
stopped
COMMA
hundreds
of
brilliant
white
flares
swayed
eerily
down
from
the
black
COMMA
the
air
raid
sirens
ashore
rose
in
a
keening
shriek
COMMA
the
anti-aircraft
guns
coughed
and
chattered
--
and
above
it
all
motors
roared
and
the
bombs
came
whispering
and
wailing
and
crashing
down
among
the
ships
at
anchor
at
Bari
.

They
had
come
from
airports
in
the
Balkans
COMMA
these
hundred
-
odd
Junkers
88's
.

They
had
winged
over
the
Adriatic
COMMA
they
had
taken
Bari
by
complete
surprise
and
now
they
were
battering
her
COMMA
attacking
with
deadly
skill
.

They
had
ruined
the
radar
warning
system
with
their
window
COMMA
they
had
made
themselves
invisible
above
their
flares
.

And
they
also
had
the
lights
of
the
city
COMMA
the
port
wall
lanterns
COMMA
and
a
shore
crane
's
spotlight
to
guide
on
.

After
the
first
two
were
blacked
out
COMMA
the
third
light
was
abandoned
by
a
terrified
Italian
crew
COMMA
who
left
their
light
to
shine
for
nine
minutes
like
an
unerring
homing
beacon
until
British
MP's
shot
it
out
.

In
that
interval
COMMA
the
German
bombers
made
a
hell
of
Bari
harbor
.

Merchant
ships
illuminated
in
the
light
of
the
flares
COMMA
made
to
seem
like
stones
imbedded
in
a
lake
of
polished
mud
COMMA
were
impossible
to
miss
.

The
little
Unsinkable
sank
almost
immediately
.

Captain
Musmanno
roared
at
his
men
to
lash
three
of
the
casks
of
olive
oil
together
for
a
raft
.

They
got
it
over
the
side
and
clambered
aboard
only
a
few
minutes
before
their
schooner
went
under
.

John
Bascom
went
down
early
COMMA
too
.

Ensign
Vesole
and
his
gunners
had
fought
valiantly
COMMA
but
they
had
no
targets
.

Most
of
the
Junkers
were
above
the
blinding
light
of
the
flares
COMMA
and
the
radar
-
controlled
shore
gun
had
been
knocked
out
by
one
of
the
first
sticks
of
bombs
.

Vesole
rushed
from
gun
to
gun
COMMA
attempting
to
direct
fire
.

He
was
wounded
COMMA
but
fought
on
.

Norton
and
Rochford
fired
wildly
at
the
sounds
of
the
motors
.

Bishop
rushed
on
deck
to
grab
a
20
-
mm
gun
COMMA
pumping
out
400
rounds
before
sticks
of
three
bombs
each
crashed
into
Holds
One
COMMA
Three
and
Five
.

Now
the
Bascom
was
mortally
wounded
.

Luckily
COMMA
she
was
not
completely
aflame
and
would
go
down
before
the
gasoline
could
erupt
.

The
order
to
abandon
ship
was
given
COMMA
but
cries
of
pain
could
be
heard
from
the
wounded
below
decks
.

Thirty-three

Scotty
did
not
go
back
to
school
.

His
parents
talked
seriously
and
lengthily
to
their
own
doctor
and
to
a
specialist
at
the
University
Hospital
--
Mr.
McKinley
was
entitled
to
a
discount
for
members
of
his
family
--
and
it
was
decided
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
take
the
remainder
of
the
term
off
COMMA
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
bed
and
COMMA
for
the
rest
COMMA
do
pretty
much
as
he
chose
--
provided
COMMA
of
course
COMMA
he
chose
to
do
nothing
too
exciting
or
too
debilitating
.

His
teacher
and
his
school
principal
were
conferred
with
and
everyone
agreed
that
COMMA
if
he
kept
up
with
a
certain
amount
of
work
at
home
COMMA
there
was
little
danger
of
his
losing
a
term
.

Scotty
accepted
the
decision
with
indifference
and
did
not
enter
the
arguments
.

He
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
after
a
two
-
day
checkup
and
he
and
his
parents
had
what
Mr.
McKinley
described
as
a
``
celebration
lunch
''
at
the
cafeteria
on
the
campus
.

Rachel
wore
a
smart
hat
and
COMMA
because
she
had
been
warned
recently
about
smoking
COMMA
puffed
at
her
cigarettes
through
a
long
ivory
holder
stained
with
lipstick
.

Scotty
's
father
sat
sprawled
in
his
chair
COMMA
angular
COMMA
alert
as
a
cricket
COMMA
looking
about
at
the
huge
stainless-steel
appointments
of
the
room
with
an
expression
of
proprietorship
.

Teachers
--
men
who
wore
brown
suits
and
had
gray
hair
and
pleasant
smiles
--
came
to
their
table
to
talk
shop
and
to
be
introduced
to
Scotty
and
Rachel
.

Rachel
was
polite
COMMA
Scotty
indifferent
.

They
ate
the
cafeteria
food
with
its
orange
sauces
and
Scotty
gazed
without
interest
at
his
food
COMMA
the
teachers
COMMA
the
heroic
baronial
windows
COMMA
and
the
bright
ranks
of
college
banners
.

His
father
tried
to
make
the
food
a
topic
.

``
The
blueberry
pie
is
good
COMMA
Scotty
.

I
recommend
it
''
.

He
looked
at
his
son
COMMA
his
face
worried
.

Scotty
murmured
COMMA
``
No
COMMA
thanks
''
COMMA
so
softly
his
father
had
to
bend
his
gaunt
height
across
the
table
and
turn
a
round
brown
ear
to
him
.

Scotty
regarded
the
ear
and
the
grizzled
hair
around
it
with
a
moment
of
interest
.

He
said
more
loudly
COMMA
``
I
'm
full
COMMA
old
Pop
''
.

He
had
eaten
almost
nothing
on
the
crested
COMMA
three
-
sectioned
plate
and
had
drunk
about
half
the
milk
in
its
paper
container
.

``
He
's
all
right
COMMA
Craig
''
COMMA
Rachel
said
.

``
I
can
fix
him
something
later
in
the
afternoon
when
we
get
home
''
.

Since
his
seizure
COMMA
Scotty
had
had
little
appetite
;
yet
his
changed
appearance
COMMA
surprisingly
COMMA
was
one
of
plumpness
.

His
face
was
fuller
;
his
lips
and
the
usually
sharp
lines
of
his
jaw
had
become
swollen
-
looking
.

He
breathed
now
with
his
mouth
open
COMMA
showing
a
whitely
curving
section
of
lower
teeth
;
he
kept
his
eyes
COMMA
with
their
puffed
blurred
lids
COMMA
always
lowered
COMMA
though
not
COMMA
apparently
COMMA
focusing
.

Even
his
neck
seemed
thicker
and
COMMA
therefore
COMMA
shorter
.

His
hands
COMMA
which
had
been
as
quick
as
a
pair
of
fluttering
birds
COMMA
were
now
neither
active
nor
really
relaxed
.

They
lay
on
his
lap
COMMA
palms
up
COMMA
stiffly
motionless
COMMA
the
tapered
fingers
a
little
thick
at
the
joints
.

Altogether
he
had
COMMA
since
the
seizure
COMMA
the
appearance
of
a
boy
who
overindulged
in
food
and
took
no
exercise
.

He
looked
lazy
COMMA
spoiled
COMMA
a
little
querulous
.

Rachel
had
little
to
say
.

She
greeted
her
husband
's
colleagues
with
smiling
politeness
COMMA
offering
nothing
.

Mr.
McKinley
COMMA
for
all
his
sprawling
and
his
easy
familiarity
COMMA
was
completely
alert
to
his
son
COMMA
eyes
always
on
the
still
face
COMMA
jumping
to
anticipate
Scotty
's
desires
.

It
was
a
strained
COMMA
silent
lunch
.

Rachel
said
COMMA
``
I
'd
better
get
him
to
bed
''
.

The
doctors
had
suggested
Scotty
remain
most
of
every
afternoon
in
bed
until
he
was
stronger
.

Since
Mr.
McKinley
had
to
give
a
lecture
COMMA
Rachel
and
Scotty
drove
home
alone
in
the
Plymouth
.

They
did
not
speak
much
.

Scotty
gazed
out
at
ugly
gray
slums
and
said
softly
COMMA
``
Look
at
those
stupid
kids
''
.

It
was
a
Negro
section
of
peeling
row
houses
COMMA
store
-
front
churches
and
ragged
children
.

Rachel
had
to
bend
toward
Scotty
and
ask
him
to
repeat
.

He
said
COMMA
``
Nothing
''
.

And
then
:
``
There
are
lots
of
kids
around
here
''
.

Scotty
looked
at
the
children
COMMA
his
mouth
slightly
opened
COMMA
his
eyes
dull
.

He
felt
tired
and
full
and
calm
.

Thirty-four

the
days
seemed
short
COMMA
perhaps
because
his
routine
was
COMMA
each
day
COMMA
almost
the
same
.

He
rose
late
and
went
down
in
his
bathrobe
and
slippers
to
have
breakfast
either
alone
or
with
Rachel
.

Virginia
treated
him
with
attention
and
tried
to
tempt
his
appetite
with
special
food
:
biscuits
COMMA
cookies
COMMA
candies
--
the
result
of
devoted
hours
in
the
tiled
kitchen
.

She
would
hover
over
him
and
COMMA
looking
like
her
brother
COMMA
anxiously
watch
the
progress
of
Scotty
's
fork
or
spoon
.

``
You
do
n't
eat
enough
COMMA
honey
.

Try
to
get
that
down
''
.

Rachel
COMMA
observing
COMMA
would
say
COMMA
``
He
has
to
rediscover
his
own
capacity
.

It
'll
take
time
''
.

Virginia
and
Rachel
talked
to
each
other
quietly
now
COMMA
as
allies
who
are
political
rather
than
natural
might
in
a
war
atmosphere
.

Both
watched
Scotty
constantly
COMMA
Rachel
without
seeming
to
COMMA
Virginia
openly
COMMA
her
eyes
filled
with
concern
.

Scotty
was
neutral
.

He
did
not
resent
their
supervision
or
Virginia
's
sometimes
tiring
sympathy
.

He
ate
what
he
felt
like
COMMA
slept
as
much
or
as
little
as
he
pleased
COMMA
and
moved
about
the
draughty
rooms
of
the
house
COMMA
when
he
was
not
in
bed
COMMA
with
slow
COMMA
dubious
steps
COMMA
like
an
elderly
tourist
in
a
cathedral
.

His
energy
was
gone
.

He
was
able
COMMA
now
COMMA
to
sit
for
hours
in
a
chair
in
the
living
room
and
stare
out
at
the
bleak
yard
without
moving
.

His
hands
lay
loosely
COMMA
yet
stiffly
--
they
were
like
wax
hands
:
almost
lifelike
COMMA
not
quite
--
folded
in
his
lap
;
his
mouth
hung
slightly
open
.

When
he
was
asked
a
question
or
addressed
in
such
a
way
that
some
response
was
inescapable
COMMA
he
would
answer
;
if
COMMA
as
often
happened
COMMA
he
had
to
repeat
because
he
had
spoken
too
softly
COMMA
he
would
repeat
his
words
in
the
same
way
COMMA
without
emphasis
or
impatience
COMMA
only
a
little
louder
.

He
had
not
mentioned
Kate
.

He
had
not
even
thought
about
her
much
except
once
or
twice
at
night
in
bed
when
his
slowly
ranging
thoughts
would
abruptly
COMMA
almost
accidentally
COMMA
encounter
her
.

At
these
times
he
felt
a
kind
of
pain
in
his
upper
chest
COMMA
but
it
was
an
objective
pain
COMMA
in
no
way
different
from
others
in
intensity
and
not
different
in
kind
;
it
was
like
the
bandaged
wound
on
the
back
of
his
head
which
occasionally
throbbed
;
it
was
merely
another
part
of
his
weakness
.

He
was
calm
COMMA
drugged
COMMA
and
lazy
.

He
did
not
care
.

Rachel
mentioned
Kate
.

She
said
COMMA
``
I
notice
the
girl
from
across
the
street
has
n't
bothered
to
phone
or
visit
''
.

Scotty
said
COMMA
``
That
's
all
right
.

Kate
's
all
right
''
.

He
thought
about
it
briefly
COMMA
then
deliberately
turned
the
talk
to
something
else
.

Once
COMMA
sitting
at
the
front
window
in
his
parents
'
room
COMMA
he
saw
Kate
come
out
of
her
house
.

She
was
with
Elizabeth
.

They
were
far
off
and
looked
tiny
.

The
heavy
branches
in
his
front
yard
would
hide
and
then
reveal
them
.

They
turned
at
the
bottom
of
Kate
's
steps
and
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
the
park
.

He
thought
he
saw
--
it
awakened
and
COMMA
for
a
moment
COMMA
interested
him
--
that
Elizabeth
held
a
leash
in
her
hand
and
that
a
round
fuzzy
puppy
was
on
the
end
of
the
leash
.

Then
they
disappeared
and
Scotty
got
up
and
went
into
his
own
room
and
got
into
bed
.

By
the
time
he
was
under
the
covers
he
had
forgotten
about
seeing
Kate
.

The
doctor
COMMA
since
Scotty
was
no
longer
allowed
to
make
his
regular
trips
into
town
to
see
him
COMMA
came
often
and
informally
to
the
house
.

He
would
sit
COMMA
slim-waisted
and
spare
COMMA
on
the
edge
of
Scotty
's
bed
COMMA
his
legs
crossed
so
elaborately
that
the
crossed
foot
could
tap
the
floor
.

Scotty
did
not
mind
the
doctor
's
unsmiling
teasing
as
he
used
to
.

``
Husky
young
man
''
COMMA
he
said
with
mock
distaste
.

``
I
imagine
you
're
always
battling
in
school
''
.

``
I
do
n't
go
to
school
any
more
''
.

``
Pardon
''
?

The
doctor
had
to
bend
close
to
hear
;
his
delicate
hand
COMMA
as
veined
as
a
moth
's
wing
COMMA
rested
absently
on
Scotty
's
chest
.

Scotty
said
the
same
words
more
loudly
.

``
Oh
.

Well
COMMA
we
're
taking
a
little
vacation
COMMA
that
's
all
''
.

He
turned
unsmilingly
to
Rachel
.

``
I
think
by
the
end
of
next
week
he
could
get
out
in
the
air
a
little
.

He
could
now
but
the
weakness
is
very
definite
;
it
would
exhaust
him
further
and
unnecessarily
.

He
'll
be
stronger
soon
''
.

His
stethoscope
was
on
the
table
by
Scotty
's
bed
and
he
picked
it
up
and
wagged
it
at
Scotty
.

He
said
fussily
COMMA
``
Just
keep
the
cap
on
those
strong
emotions
''
.

The
stethoscope
glinted
silver
in
the
darkening
room
.

``
I
'll
drop
by
again
in
a
few
days
''
.

Rachel
stayed
on
after
the
doctor
had
gone
.

She
smoothed
the
covers
on
Scotty
's
bed
and
picked
things
up
from
the
floor
.

She
did
not
touch
him
.

Scotty
watched
with
disinterest
.

He
did
not
speak
.

He
had
no
desire
to
.

She
said
COMMA
``
Do
you
think
you
'll
miss
school
''
?

He
had
noticed
how
formal
and
irritably
exact
Rachel
had
grown
.

He
did
not
care
.

He
felt
her
irritability
did
not
concern
him
COMMA
yet
he
knew
he
would
not
care
even
if
it
did
.

He
shook
his
head
.

``
We
've
had
any
number
of
calls
about
you
.

You
could
win
a
popularity
contest
at
that
school
without
any
trouble
.

Miss
Estherson
called
twice
.

She
wants
to
pay
you
a
visit
.

She
says
the
children
miss
you
.

Apparently
you
were
the
light
of
their
lives
''
.

Scotty
shrugged
slightly
.

Rachel
came
close
to
the
bed
COMMA
bent
as
if
she
would
kiss
him
COMMA
then
moved
away
.

She
was
frowning
.

``
That
doctor
annoys
me
''
.

She
seemed
to
speak
to
herself
.

``
Do
you
suppose
his
self
-
consciousness
is
characteristic
of
the
new
Negro
professionals
or
merely
of
doctors
in
general
''
?

She
turned
to
him
again
.

``
Well
COMMA
Mrs.
Charles
--
Sally
--
has
phoned
too
.

She
was
very
worried
''
.

Rachel
's
tone
was
dry
.

``
She
did
n't
really
say
''
--
She
glanced
away
at
the
floor
COMMA
then
swooped
gracefully
and
picked
up
one
of
Scotty
's
slippers
.

``
I
mean
COMMA
do
you
feel
like
seeing
Kate
''
?

Scotty
said
COMMA
``
I
do
n't
know
''
.

It
was
true
.

He
did
not
.

There
was
the
slight
pain
COMMA
but
it
was
no
different
from
the
throbbing
in
his
head
.

``
Well
COMMA
there
's
time
COMMA
in
any
case
.

We
'll
wait
till
you
're
stronger
and
then
talk
about
it
''
.

She
put
the
slipper
neatly
by
its
mate
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.

Scotty
said
COMMA
``
Okay
''
.

This
time
Rachel
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
.

Scotty
was
pleased
.

His
father
was
a
constant
visitor
.

Scotty
would
hear
the
front
door
in
the
evening
and
then
his
father
's
deep
slow
voice
;
it
floated
up
the
stairs
.

``
How
's
Scotty
''
?

And
Rachel
's
or
Virginia
's
reply
:
``
better
.

He
's
getting
plenty
of
rest
''
.

``
Is
his
appetite
improved
''
?

Or
:
``
Does
he
get
exercise
''
?

The
exchange
was
almost
invariable
COMMA
and
Scotty
COMMA
in
his
bed
COMMA
could
hear
every
word
of
it
.

He
never
smiled
.

It
required
an
energy
he
no
longer
possessed
to
be
satirical
about
his
father
.

His
father
would
come
upstairs
and
stand
self-consciously
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
look
at
his
son
.

After
a
pause
COMMA
during
which
he
studied
Scotty
's
face
as
if
Scotty
were
not
there
and
could
not
study
him
too
COMMA
Mr.
McKinley
would
ask
the
same
questions
he
had
asked
downstairs
.

Scotty
would
reply
softly
and
his
father
COMMA
apologetically
COMMA
would
ask
him
to
repeat
.

``
I
'm
eating
more
''
COMMA
he
would
say
.

Or
:
``
I
walk
around
the
house
a
lot
''
.

``
Perhaps
you
should
get
out
a
little
''
.

``
I
'm
not
supposed
to
yet
''
.

He
was
not
irritated
.

He
did
not
mind
the
useless
COMMA
kindly
questions
.

He
looked
at
the
lined
face
with
vague
interest
;
he
felt
he
was
noting
it
COMMA
as
if
it
were
something
he
might
think
about
when
he
grew
stronger
.

Mr.
McKinley
examined
everything
with
critical
care
COMMA
seeking
something
material
to
blame
for
his
son
's
illness
.

``
Have
you
got
enough
blankets
''
?

And
another
time
COMMA
without
accusation
:
``
You
never
wore
that
scarf
I
bought
you
''
.

The
expense
and
time
involved
are
astronomical
.

However
COMMA
we
sent
a
third
vessel
out
COMMA
a
much
smaller
and
faster
one
than
the
first
two
.

We
have
learned
much
about
interstellar
drives
since
a
hundred
years
ago
;
that
is
all
I
can
tell
you
about
them
.

``
But
the
third
ship
came
back
several
years
ago
and
reported
''

``
That
it
had
found
a
planet
on
which
human
beings
could
live
and
which
was
already
inhabited
by
sentient
beings
''
!
Said
Hal
COMMA
forgetting
in
his
enthusiasm
that
he
had
not
been
asked
to
speak
.

Macneff
stopped
pacing
to
stare
at
Hal
with
his
pale
blue
eyes
.

``
How
did
you
know
''
?
He
said
sharply
.

``
Forgive
me
COMMA
Sandalphon
''
COMMA
said
Hal
.

``
But
it
was
inevitable
!

Did
not
the
Forerunner
predict
in
his
Time
and
the
World
Line
that
such
a
planet
would
be
found
?

I
believe
it
was
on
page
573
''
!

Macneff
smiled
and
said
COMMA
``
I
am
glad
that
your
scriptural
lessons
have
left
such
an
impression
''
.

How
could
they
not
?
Thought
Hal
.

Besides
COMMA
they
were
not
the
only
impressions
.

I
still
bear
scars
on
my
back
where
Pornsen
COMMA
my
gapt
COMMA
whipped
me
because
I
had
not
learned
my
lessons
well
enough
.

He
was
a
good
impresser
COMMA
that
Pornsen
.

Was
?

Is
!

As
I
grew
older
and
was
promoted
COMMA
so
was
he
COMMA
always
where
I
was
.

He
was
my
gapt
in
the
creche
.

He
was
the
dormitory
gapt
when
I
went
to
college
and
thought
I
was
getting
away
from
him
.

He
is
now
my
block
gapt
.

He
is
the
one
responsible
for
my
getting
such
low
M.R.'s
.

Swiftly
COMMA
came
the
revulsion
COMMA
the
protest
.

No
COMMA
not
he
COMMA
for
I
COMMA
and
I
alone
COMMA
am
responsible
for
whatever
happens
to
me
.

If
I
get
a
low
M.R.
COMMA
I
do
so
because
I
want
it
that
way
or
my
dark
self
does
.

If
I
die
COMMA
I
die
because
I
willed
it
so
.

So
COMMA
forgive
me
COMMA
Sigmen
COMMA
for
the
contrary
-
to
-
reality
thoughts
!

``
Please
pardon
me
again
COMMA
Sandalphon
''
COMMA
said
Hal
.

``
But
did
the
expedition
find
any
records
of
the
Forerunner
having
been
on
this
planet
?
Perhaps
COMMA
even
COMMA
though
this
is
too
much
to
wish
COMMA
find
the
Forerunner
himself
''
?

``
No
''
COMMA
said
Macneff
.

``
Though
that
does
not
mean
that
there
may
not
be
such
records
there
.

The
expedition
was
under
orders
to
make
a
swift
survey
of
conditions
and
then
to
return
to
Earth
.

I
can't
tell
you
now
the
distance
in
lightyears
or
what
star
this
was
COMMA
though
you
can
see
it
with
the
naked
eye
at
night
in
this
hemisphere
.

If
you
volunteer
COMMA
you
will
be
told
where
you
're
going
after
the
ship
leaves
.

And
it
leaves
very
soon
''
.

``
You
need
a
linguist
''
?
Said
Hal
.

``
The
ship
is
huge
''
COMMA
said
Macneff
COMMA
``
but
the
number
of
military
men
and
specialists
we
are
taking
limits
the
linguists
to
one
.

We
have
considered
several
of
your
professionals
because
they
were
lamechians
and
above
suspicion
.

Unfortunately
''

Hal
waited
:
Macneff
paced
some
more
COMMA
frowning
.

Then
COMMA
he
said
COMMA
``
Unfortunately
COMMA
only
one
lamechian
linguist
exists
COMMA
and
he
is
too
old
for
this
expedition
.

Therefore
''

``
A
thousand
pardons
''
COMMA
said
Hal
.

``
But
I
have
just
thought
of
one
thing
.

I
am
married
''
.

``
No
problem
at
all
''
COMMA
said
Macneff
.

``
There
will
be
no
women
aboard
the
Gabriel
.

And
COMMA
if
a
man
is
married
COMMA
he
will
automatically
be
given
a
divorce
''
.

Hal
gasped
COMMA
and
he
said
COMMA
``
A
divorce
''
?

Macneff
raised
his
hands
apologetically
and
said
COMMA
``
You
are
horrified
COMMA
of
course
.

But
COMMA
from
our
reading
of
the
Western
Talmud
COMMA
we
Urielites
believe
that
the
Forerunner
COMMA
knowing
this
situation
would
arise
COMMA
made
reference
to
and
provision
for
divorce
.

It
's
inevitable
in
this
case
COMMA
for
the
couple
will
be
separated
for
COMMA
at
the
least
COMMA
forty
years
.

Naturally
COMMA
he
couched
the
provision
in
obscure
language
.

In
his
great
and
glorious
wisdom
COMMA
he
knew
that
our
enemies
the
Israelites
must
not
be
able
to
read
therein
what
we
planned
''
.

``
I
volunteer
''
COMMA
said
Hal
.

``
Tell
me
more
COMMA
Sandalphon
''
.

Six
months
later
COMMA
Hal
Yarrow
stood
in
the
observation
dome
of
the
Gabriel
and
watched
the
ball
of
Earth
dwindle
above
him
.

It
was
night
on
this
hemisphere
COMMA
but
the
light
blazed
from
the
megalopolises
of
Australia
COMMA
Japan
COMMA
China
COMMA
Southeast
Asia
COMMA
India
COMMA
Siberia
.

Hal
COMMA
the
linguist
COMMA
saw
the
glittering
discs
and
necklaces
in
terms
of
the
languages
spoken
therein
.

Australia
COMMA
the
Philippine
Islands
COMMA
Japan
COMMA
and
northern
China
were
inhabited
by
those
members
of
the
Haijac
Union
that
spoke
American
.

Southern
China
COMMA
all
of
southeast
Asia
COMMA
southern
India
and
Ceylon
COMMA
these
states
of
the
Malay
Federation
spoke
Bazaar
.

Siberia
spoke
Icelandic
.

His
mind
turned
the
globe
swiftly
for
him
COMMA
and
he
visualized
Africa
COMMA
which
used
Swahili
south
of
the
Sahara
Sea
.

All
around
the
Mediterranean
Sea
COMMA
Asia
Minor
COMMA
northern
India
COMMA
and
Tibet
COMMA
Hebrew
was
the
native
tongue
.

In
southern
Europe
COMMA
between
the
Israeli
Republics
and
the
Icelandic
-
speaking
peoples
of
northern
Europe
COMMA
was
a
thin
but
long
stretch
of
territory
called
March
.

This
was
no
man
's
land
COMMA
disputed
by
the
Haijac
Union
and
the
Israeli
Republic
COMMA
a
potential
source
of
war
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
.

Neither
nation
would
give
up
their
claim
on
it
COMMA
yet
neither
wished
to
make
any
move
that
might
lead
to
a
second
Apocalyptic
War
.

So
COMMA
for
all
practical
purposes
COMMA
it
was
an
independent
nation
and
by
now
had
its
own
organized
government
(
unrecognized
outside
its
own
borders
)
.

Its
citizens
spoke
all
of
the
world
's
surviving
tongues
COMMA
plus
a
new
one
called
Lingo
COMMA
a
pidgin
whose
vocabulary
was
derived
from
the
other
six
and
whose
syntax
was
so
simple
it
could
be
contained
on
half
a
sheet
of
paper
.

Hal
saw
in
his
mind
the
rest
of
Earth
:
Iceland
COMMA
Greenland
COMMA
the
Caribbean
Islands
COMMA
and
the
eastern
half
of
South
America
.

Here
the
peoples
spoke
the
tongue
of
Iceland
because
that
island
had
gotten
the
jump
on
the
Hawaiian-Americans
who
were
busy
resettling
North
America
and
the
western
half
of
South
America
after
the
Apocalyptic
War
.

Then
there
was
North
America
COMMA
where
American
was
the
native
speech
of
all
except
the
twenty
descendants
of
French-Canadians
living
on
the
Hudson
Bay
Preserve
.

Hal
knew
that
when
that
side
of
Earth
rotated
into
the
night
zone
COMMA
Sigmen
City
would
blaze
out
into
space
.

And
COMMA
somewhere
in
that
enormous
light
COMMA
was
his
apartment
.

But
Mary
would
soon
no
longer
be
living
there
COMMA
for
she
would
be
notified
in
a
few
days
that
her
husband
had
died
in
an
accident
while
on
a
flight
to
Tahiti
.

She
would
weep
in
private
COMMA
he
was
sure
COMMA
for
she
loved
him
in
her
frigid
way
COMMA
though
in
public
she
would
be
dry-eyed
.

Her
friends
and
professional
associates
would
sympathize
with
her
COMMA
not
because
she
had
lost
a
beloved
husband
COMMA
but
because
she
had
been
married
to
a
man
who
thought
unrealistically
.

If
Hal
Yarrow
had
been
killed
in
a
crash
COMMA
he
must
have
wanted
it
that
way
.

There
was
no
such
thing
as
an
``
accident
''
.

Somehow
COMMA
all
the
other
passengers
(
also
supposed
to
have
died
in
this
web
of
elaborate
frauds
to
cover
up
the
disappearance
of
the
personnel
of
the
Gabriel
)
had
simultaneously
``
agreed
''
to
die
.

And
COMMA
therefore
COMMA
being
in
disgrace
COMMA
they
would
not
be
cremated
and
their
ashes
flung
to
the
winds
in
public
ceremony
.

No
COMMA
the
fish
could
eat
their
bodies
for
all
the
Sturch
cared
.

Hal
felt
sorry
for
Mary
;
he
had
a
time
keeping
the
tears
from
welling
to
his
own
eyes
as
he
stood
in
the
crowd
in
the
observation
dome
.

Yet
COMMA
he
told
himself
COMMA
this
was
the
best
way
.

He
and
Mary
would
no
longer
have
to
tear
and
rend
at
each
other
;
their
mutual
torture
would
be
over
.

Mary
was
free
to
marry
again
COMMA
not
knowing
that
the
Sturch
had
secretly
given
her
a
divorce
COMMA
thinking
that
death
had
dissolved
her
marriage
.

She
would
have
a
year
in
which
to
make
up
her
mind
COMMA
to
choose
a
mate
from
a
list
selected
by
her
gapt
.

Perhaps
COMMA
the
psychological
barriers
that
had
prevented
her
from
conceiving
Hal
's
child
would
no
longer
be
present
.

Perhaps
.

Hal
doubted
if
this
happy
event
would
occur
.

Mary
was
as
frozen
below
the
navel
as
he
.

No
matter
who
the
candidate
for
marriage
selected
by
the
gapt

The
gapt
.

Pornsen
.

He
would
no
longer
have
to
see
that
fat
face
COMMA
hear
that
whining
voice

``
Hal
Yarrow
''
!
Said
the
whining
voice
.

And
COMMA
slowly
COMMA
feeling
himself
icy
yet
burning
COMMA
Hal
turned
.

There
was
the
squat
loose-jowled
man
COMMA
smiling
lopsidedly
up
at
him
.

``
My
beloved
ward
COMMA
my
perennial
gadfly
''
COMMA
said
the
whining
voice
.

``
I
had
no
idea
that
you
COMMA
too
COMMA
would
be
on
this
glorious
voyage
.

But
I
might
have
known
!

We
seem
to
be
bound
by
love
;
Sigmen
himself
must
have
foreseen
it
.

Love
to
you
COMMA
my
ward
''
.

``
Sigmen
love
you
COMMA
too
COMMA
my
guardian
''
COMMA
said
Hal
COMMA
choking
.

``
How
wonderful
to
see
your
cherished
self
.

I
had
thought
we
would
never
again
speak
to
each
other
''
.

the
Gabriel
pointed
towards
her
destination
and
COMMA
under
one
-
gee
acceleration
COMMA
began
to
build
up
towards
her
ultimate
velocity
COMMA
99.1
percent
of
the
speed
of
light
.

Meanwhile
COMMA
all
the
personnel
except
those
few
needed
to
carry
out
the
performance
of
the
ship
COMMA
went
into
the
suspensor
.

Here
they
would
lie
in
suspended
animation
for
many
years
.

Some
time
later
COMMA
after
a
check
had
been
made
of
all
automatic
equipment
COMMA
the
crew
would
join
the
others
.

They
would
sleep
while
the
Gabriel
's
drive
would
increase
the
acceleration
to
a
point
which
the
unfrozen
bodies
of
the
personnel
could
not
have
endured
.

Upon
reaching
the
desired
speed
COMMA
the
automatic
equipment
would
cut
off
the
drive
COMMA
and
the
silent
but
not
empty
vessel
would
hurl
towards
the
star
which
was
its
journey
's
end
.

Many
years
later
COMMA
the
photon
-
counting
apparatus
in
the
nose
of
the
ship
would
determine
that
the
star
was
close
enough
to
actuate
deceleration
.

Again
COMMA
a
force
too
strong
for
unfrozen
bodies
to
endure
would
be
applied
.

Then
COMMA
after
slowing
the
vessel
considerably
COMMA
the
drive
would
adjust
to
a
one
-
gee
deceleration
.

And
the
crew
would
be
automatically
brought
out
of
their
suspended
animation
.

These
members
would
then
unthaw
the
rest
of
the
personnel
.

And
COMMA
in
the
half-year
left
before
reaching
their
destination
COMMA
the
men
would
carry
out
whatever
preparations
were
needed
.

Hal
Yarrow
was
among
the
last
to
go
into
the
suspensor
and
among
the
first
to
come
out
.

He
had
to
study
the
recordings
of
the
language
of
the
chief
nation
of
Ozagen
COMMA
Siddo
.

And
COMMA
from
the
first
COMMA
he
faced
a
difficult
task
.

The
expedition
that
had
discovered
Ozagen
had
succeeded
in
correlating
two
thousand
Siddo
words
with
an
equal
number
of
American
words
.

The
description
of
the
Siddo
syntax
was
very
restricted
.

And
COMMA
as
Hal
found
out
COMMA
obviously
mistaken
in
many
cases
.

This
discovery
caused
Hal
anxiety
.

His
duty
was
to
write
a
school
text
and
to
teach
the
entire
personnel
of
the
Gabriel
how
to
speak
Ozagen
.

Yet
COMMA
if
he
used
all
of
the
little
means
at
his
disposal
COMMA
he
would
be
instructing
his
students
wrongly
.

Moreover
COMMA
even
getting
this
across
would
be
difficult
.

For
one
thing
COMMA
the
organs
of
speech
of
the
Ozagen
natives
differed
somewhat
from
Earthmen
's
;
the
sounds
made
by
these
organs
were
COMMA
therefore
COMMA
dissimilar
.

It
was
true
that
they
could
be
approximated
COMMA
but
would
the
Ozagenians
understand
these
approximations
?

Another
obstacle
was
the
grammatical
construction
of
Siddo
.

Consider
the
tense
system
.

Instead
of
inflecting
a
verb
or
using
an
unattached
particle
to
indicate
the
past
or
future
COMMA
Siddo
used
an
entirely
different
word
.

Thus
COMMA
the
masculine
animate
infinitive
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai
COMMA
meaning
to
live
COMMA
was
COMMA
in
the
perfect
tense
COMMA
ksu'u'peli'afo
COMMA
and
COMMA
in
the
future
COMMA
mai'teipa
.

The
same
use
of
an
entirely
different
word
applied
for
all
the
other
tenses
.

Plus
the
fact
that
Siddo
not
only
had
the
normal
(
to
Earthmen
)
three
genders
of
masculine
COMMA
feminine
COMMA
and
neuter
COMMA
but
the
two
extra
of
inanimate
and
spiritual
.

Fortunately
COMMA
gender
was
inflected
COMMA
though
the
expression
of
it
would
be
difficult
for
anybody
not
born
in
Siddo
.

The
system
of
indicating
gender
varied
according
to
tense
.

All
the
other
parts
of
speech
:
nouns
COMMA
pronouns
COMMA
adjectives
COMMA
adverbs
COMMA
and
conjunctions
operated
under
the
same
system
as
the
verbs
.

They
neither
liked
nor
disliked
the
Old
Man
.

To
them
he
could
have
been
the
broken
bell
in
the
church
tower
which
rang
before
and
after
Mass
COMMA
and
at
noon
COMMA
and
at
six
each
evening
--
its
tone
COMMA
repetitive
COMMA
monotonous
COMMA
never
breaking
the
boredom
of
the
streets
.

The
Old
Man
was
unimportant
.

Yet
if
he
were
not
there
COMMA
they
would
have
missed
him
COMMA
as
they
would
have
missed
the
sounds
of
bees
buzzing
against
the
screen
door
in
early
June
;
or
the
smell
of
thick
tomato
paste
--
the
ripe
smell
that
was
both
sweet
and
sour
--
rising
up
from
aluminum
trays
wrapped
in
fly
-
dotted
cheesecloth
.

Or
the
surging
whirling
sounds
of
bats
at
night
COMMA
when
their
black
bodies
dived
into
the
blackness
above
and
below
the
amber
street
lights
.

Or
the
bay
of
female
dogs
in
heat
.

They
never
called
him
by
name
COMMA
although
he
had
one
.

Filippo
Rossi
COMMA
that
's
what
he
was
called
in
the
old
country
;
but
here
he
was
just
Signore
or
the
Old
Man
.

But
this
was
not
unusual
COMMA
because
youth
in
these
quarters
was
always
pushed
at
a
distance
from
its
elders
.

Youth
obeyed
when
commanded
.

It
went
to
church
on
Sunday
and
one
Saturday
a
month
went
to
confession
.

But
youth
asked
nothing
of
its
parents
--
not
a
touch
of
the
hand
or
a
kiss
given
in
passing
.

The
only
thing
unusual
about
the
Old
Man
had
long
since
happened
.

But
the
past
was
dead
here
as
the
present
was
dead
.

Once
the
Old
Man
had
had
a
wife
.

And
once
she
COMMA
too
COMMA
ignored
him
.

With
a
tiny
fur
-
piece
wrapped
around
her
shoulders
COMMA
she
wiggled
her
satin
-
covered
buttocks
down
the
street
before
him
and
did
n't
stop
.

In
one
hand
she
clutched
a
hundred
dollar
bill
and
in
the
other
a
straw
suitcase
.

The
way
she
strutted
down
the
street
COMMA
the
Old
Man
would
have
been
blind
not
to
have
noticed
both
.

Without
looking
at
him
COMMA
without
looking
at
anything
except
Drexel
Street
directly
in
front
of
her
COMMA
she
climbed
up
into
one
of
those
orange
streetcars
COMMA
rode
away
in
it
COMMA
and
never
came
back
.

``
But
she
should
n't
have
come
here
in
the
first
place
''
COMMA
the
women
had
said
.

``
No
COMMA
no
.

Not
that
one
.

She
thought
she
was
bigger
than
we
are
because
she
came
from
Torino
''
.

``
Eh
COMMA
Torino
!

She
gave
herself
fancy
airs
!

Just
because
she
had
a
part
on
the
stage
in
the
old
country
COMMA
she
thought
she
could
carry
her
head
higher
than
ours
''
.

They
had
slapped
their
thighs
.

``
It
's
not
for
making
pretty
speeches
about
Dante
those
actresses
get
paid
so
good
''
.

``
Henh
''
!

Calloused
fingers
COMMA
caressed
only
by
the
smoothness
of
polished
rosaries
COMMA
had
swayed
excitedly
beneath
puckered
chins
where
tiny
black
hairs
sprouted
COMMA
never
to
be
tweezed
away
.

Mauve
-
colored
mouths
that
had
never
known
anything
sweeter
than
the
taste
of
new
wine
and
the
passion
of
man
's
tongue
had
not
smiled
COMMA
but
had
condemned
again
and
again
.

``
Puttana
''
!

But
if
the
Old
Man
even
thought
about
his
wife
now
COMMA
nobody
cared
a
fig
.

It
was
enough
for
people
to
know
that
at
one
time
he
had
looked
down
the
street
at
the
fleshy
suppleness
of
a
woman
he
had
consumed
--
watching
her
become
thinner
and
thinner
in
the
distance
COMMA
as
thin
as
the
seams
on
her
stockings
COMMA
and
still
thinner
.

His
voice
had
not
commanded
her
to
stop
.

It
had
not
questioned
why
.

The
women
said
they
had
seen
him
wave
an
exhausted
farewell
;
but
he
might
have
been
shooing
away
the
fleas
that
hopped
from
his
yellow
dog
onto
him
.

(
He
was
never
without
that
dog
.
)

And
his
eyes
--
those
miniature
sundials
of
variegated
yellow
--
had
not
altered
their
expression
or
direction
.

The
Old
Man
's
very
soul
could
have
left
him
and
flown
down
that
street
COMMA
but
he
would
n't
have
had
anyone
know
it
.

Perhaps
he
had
known
then
where
that
hundred
dollar
bill
had
come
from
and
where
it
was
taking
his
wife
.

But
when
he
called
for
his
withered
COMMA
wrinkled
sister
Rose
to
care
for
him
and
the
children
COMMA
had
he
guessed
that
all
he
would
remember
of
his
woman
was
the
memory
of
her
climbing
into
that
streetcar
?

There
seemed
to
be
a
contemptuous
purpose
in
the
way
he
sat
there
with
his
eyes
glued
to
Drexel
Street
and
his
back
in
opposition
to
the
church
behind
him
.

For
all
he
saw
or
cared
to
see
COMMA
this
could
have
been
a
town
in
Italy
COMMA
not
the
outskirts
of
Philadelphia
.

It
could
have
been
Bari
or
Chieti
for
the
way
it
smelled
.

What
did
it
matter
to
him
that
the
park
at
the
foot
of
Ash
Road
stretched
beneath
elevated
trains
that
roared
from
the
stucco
station
into
the
city
's
center
at
half-hour
intervals
?

Or
that
the
tiny
creek
spun
its
silent
course
toward
the
Schuylkill
?

This
place
was
hatred
to
him
COMMA
just
as
hatred
was
his
only
companion
in
his
aloneness
.

To
him
they
were
one
and
the
same
.

Sameness
for
the
Old
Man
was
framed
in
by
a
wall
of
ginkgo
trees
which
divided
these
quarters
from
the
city
.

Sameness
lined
the
streets
with
two
-
story
houses
the
color
of
ash
.

It
slashed
the
sloping
manure
-
scented
lawns
with
concrete
steps
which
climbed
upward
to
white
wooden
porches
.

It
swayed
with
the
wicker
swings
and
screeched
with
the
rusted
hinges
of
screen
doors
.

Even
the
stable
-
garage
COMMA
which
housed
nothing
now
but
the
scent
of
rot
COMMA
had
a
lawn
before
it
.

And
the
coffee
shop
on
Drexel
Street
COMMA
where
the
men
spent
their
evenings
and
Sundays
playing
cards
COMMA
had
a
rose
hedge
beneath
its
window
.

The
hedge
reeked
of
coffee
dregs
thrown
against
it
.

Only
one
house
on
the
street
had
no
lawn
before
it
.

It
squatted
low
and
square
upon
the
sidewalk
with
a
heavy
iron
grating
supporting
a
glass
facade
.

That
was
Bartoli
's
shop
.

Above
it
COMMA
from
a
second-story
showroom
COMMA
wooden
angels
surveyed
the
neighborhood
.

Did
the
Old
Man
remember
them
there
?

Yet
everywhere
else
sameness
was
stucco
and
wood
in
square
blocks
--
like
fortresses
perched
against
the
slant
of
the
hill
COMMA
rising
with
the
hill
to
the
top
where
the
church
was
and
beyond
that
to
the
cemetery
.

Only
paved
alleyways
tunneled
through
the
walls
of
those
fortresses
into
the
mysterious
core
of
intimacy
behind
the
houses
where
backyards
owned
no
fences
COMMA
where
one
man
's
property
blended
with
the
next
to
form
courtyards
in
which
no
one
knew
privacy
.

Love
and
hatred
and
fear
were
one
here
COMMA
shaded
only
by
fig
trees
and
grape
vines
.

And
the
forked
tongue
of
gossip
licked
its
sinister
way
from
back
porch
to
back
porch
.

The
Old
Man
silently
fed
upon
these
streets
.

They
kept
him
alive
COMMA
waiting
.

Waiting
for
what
and
for
whom
COMMA
only
he
could
tell
and
would
not
.

It
was
as
though
he
had
made
a
pact
with
the
devil
himself
COMMA
but
it
was
not
yet
time
to
pay
the
price
.

He
was
holding
out
for
something
.

He
was
determined
to
hold
out
.

The
Old
Man
's
son
threw
himself
down
COMMA
belly
first
COMMA
upon
a
concrete
step
COMMA
taking
in
the
coolness
of
it
COMMA
and
dreaming
of
the
day
he
would
be
rich
.

At
fifteen
he
did
n't
care
that
he
had
no
mother
COMMA
that
he
could
n't
remember
her
face
or
her
touch
;
neither
did
he
care
that
Aunt
Rose
provided
for
him
.

He
was
named
Pompeii
as
a
tribute
to
his
heritage
COMMA
and
he
could
n't
have
cared
less
about
that
either
.

To
him
life
was
a
restless
boredom
that
began
with
the
rising
sun
and
ended
only
with
sleep
.

When
he
would
be
a
man
COMMA
he
would
be
a
rich
man
.

He
would
not
be
like
the
``
rich
Americans
''
who
lived
in
white
-
columned
houses
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
.

He
would
not
ride
the
eight-thirty
local
to
the
city
each
morning
.

He
would
not
carry
a
brief
case
.

Nor
would
he
work
at
all
.

He
would
square
his
shoulders
and
carry
a
cane
before
each
step
.

He
would
sit
inside
the
coffee
shop
and
pound
a
gloved
fist
upon
the
table
and
a
girl
would
hear
him
and
come
running
COMMA
bowing
with
her
running
COMMA
calling
out
in
her
bowing
COMMA
``
At
your
service
''
.

He
would
order
her
to
bring
coffee
COMMA
and
would
take
from
his
vest
pocket
a
thin
black
pipe
which
he
would
stuff
--
he
would
not
remove
his
gloves
--
and
light
and
smoke
.

He
could
do
that
when
he
would
be
a
man
.

``
Hey
COMMA
Laura
''
!

He
called
to
his
sister
on
the
porch
above
the
steps
.

She
was
only
ten
months
older
than
he
.

``
Laura
COMMA
what
would
you
say
if
I
smoked
a
pipe
''
?

Laura
did
not
answer
him
.

She
leaned
unconcerned
against
the
broken
porch
fence
COMMA
brushing
and
drying
her
wet
COMMA
gilded
hair
in
the
sun
.

One
lithe
leg
straddled
the
railing
and
swung
loosely
before
the
creaking
COMMA
torn
pales
.

Her
tanned
foot
COMMA
whose
arch
swept
high
and
white
COMMA
pointed
artfully
toward
tapering
toes
--
toes
like
fingers
COMMA
whose
tips
glowed
white
.

All
the
while
she
sat
there
COMMA
her
sinewy
arms
swirled
before
her
chest
.

Her
face
showed
no
sign
of
having
heard
Pompeii
.

It
was
a
face
that
had
lost
its
childlike
softness
and
was
beginning
to
fold
within
its
fragile
features
a
harshness
that
belied
the
lyric
lines
of
its
contours
.

The
eyes
COMMA
blue
and
always
somewhat
downcast
COMMA
possessed
a
sullen
quality
.

Even
though
the
boy
could
not
see
them
COMMA
he
knew
they
were
clouded
by
distance
.

He
was
never
sure
they
fully
took
him
in
.

Pompeii
called
again
COMMA
``
Laura
''
!

But
the
only
answer
that
reached
him
was
the
screeching
of
the
porch
rail
from
her
leg
moving
against
it
.

``
She
's
in
a
mood
''
COMMA
he
thought
``
There
's
not
a
month
she
does
n't
get
herself
in
a
mood
''
.

Well
COMMA
what
did
that
matter
when
the
sun
was
shining
and
there
were
dreams
to
dream
about
?

And
as
for
his
pipe
COMMA
if
he
wanted
to
smoke
one
COMMA
nobody
would
stop
him
.

Not
even
Laura
.

Suddenly
he
was
interrupted
in
his
daydreaming
by
a
warm
wetness
lapping
against
his
chin
COMMA
and
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
long
at
the
sight
of
a
goat
's
claret
tongue
COMMA
feasting
against
the
salt
taste
of
him
.

Above
the
tongue
COMMA
an
aged
yellow
eye
COMMA
sallow
and
time
-
cast
COMMA
encrusted
within
a
sphere
of
marbleized
pink
skin
COMMA
stared
unfalteringly
at
him
.

``
Christ
sake
COMMA
goat
COMMA
git
''
!

But
the
goat
would
not
.

``
You
're
boiling
milk
COMMA
ai
n't
you
''
?

Soothing
it
with
his
hand
COMMA
knowing
the
whiskered
jowls
and
the
swollen
smoothness
of
teats
that
wrinkled
expectantly
to
his
touch
.

Pompeii
rolled
over
.

His
head
undulated
gradually
COMMA
covering
space
COMMA
to
come
straining
beneath
the
taut
belly
within
the
warmth
of
those
teats
.

With
his
mouth
opened
wide
COMMA
he
squirted
the
warm
white
milk
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
and
his
tongue
savored
the
light
COMMA
earthy
taste
of
it
.

The
boy
's
fingers
and
mouth
operated
with
the
skilled
unity
of
a
bagpipe
player
COMMA
pressing
and
pulling
COMMA
delighting
in
what
he
did
.

Above
him
slid
the
evasive
shadow
of
a
storm
cloud
.

Its
form
was
a
heavy
figure
in
a
fluttering
soutane
.

But
the
boy
could
see
only
the
goat
's
belly
.

The
Old
Man
near
the
corner
let
the
shadow
pass
over
him
COMMA
sensing
something
portentous
in
it
.

He
knew
it
was
there
COMMA
knew
also
what
it
was
about
COMMA
but
he
would
n't
raise
a
finger
except
to
smooth
his
yellow
dog
's
back
.

There
would
be
time
enough
COMMA
perhaps
the
Old
Man
reassured
himself
COMMA
to
pay
the
devil
his
due
.

Time
enough
to
give
up
his
soul
.

In
the
meantime
COMMA
six
sandals
COMMA
stained
an
ocher
COMMA
the
same
color
as
Pompeii
's
shaved
hair
COMMA
edged
up
close
to
him
.

The
clapping
they
made
on
the
concrete
interrupted
him
in
the
ecstatic
pleasure
he
knew
COMMA
so
that
he
quickly
released
his
hold
on
the
goat
and
pretended
to
be
examining
its
haunches
for
ticks
.

He
knew
at
a
glance
that
the
biggest
sandals
belonged
to
Niobe
COMMA
the
neatest
ones
to
Concetta
COMMA
and
the
laced
ones
to
Romeo
COMMA
Concetta
's
idiot
brother
.

Pompeii
expected
Romeo
's
small
body
to
sink
closer
and
closer
to
the
ground
.

He
expected
Concetta
's
thin
hand
to
reach
down
to
grasp
the
boy
COMMA
and
her
shrill
COMMA
impetuous
voice
to
sound
against
the
rotundity
of
his
disfigured
flesh
that
was
never
sure
of
hearing
anything
.
