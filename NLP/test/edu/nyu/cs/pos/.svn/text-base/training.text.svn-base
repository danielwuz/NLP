Dear
Personal
Donor
:

In
the
short
while
since
Goodwill
helped
him
find
his
job
COMMA
Robert
has
learned
to
thoroughly
clean
a
motel
room
in
about
40
minutes
.

His
job
objectives
call
for
him
to
do
it
in
30
.

He
has
no
time
to
waste
.

Neither
do
we
.

With
the
help
of
friends
like
you
COMMA
Goodwill
has
continued
to
adapt
our
services
to
meet
the
human
needs
of
our
changing
society
.

We
do
n't
waste
time
as
we
are
helping
the
community
.

And
we
do
n't
waste
money
.

The
gift
that
I
am
asking
you
to
make
will
be
used
to
continue
our
mission
of
helping
people
prepare
for
COMMA
find
and
keep
jobs
.

In
their
December
COMMA
1995
review
of
the
nation
's
best
charities
COMMA
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
called
Goodwill
one
of
the
five
"
Standout
Good
Guys
.
"

The
magazine
stated
that
Goodwill
(
as
well
as
the
other
standouts
)
is
"
uniquely
effective
COMMA
innovative
or
valuable
.
"

While
I
appreciate
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
's
endorsement
COMMA
the
true
value
of
your
support
is
measured
by
the
way
Goodwill
takes
on
problems
that
affect
all
of
us
.

Every
time
we
help
someone
find
a
solution
to
their
employment
barrier
COMMA
the
positive
effects
radiate
throughout
our
community
:
The
business
community
welcomes
not
only
another
worker
COMMA
but
a
consumer
with
increased
purchasing
power
.

Parents
act
as
role
models
of
self-sufficiency
instead
of
dependency
.

Tax
dollars
that
would
have
been
spent
on
public
assistance
are
saved
.

You
and
I
know
that
solutions
to
difficult
problems
do
n't
just
happen
.

At
Goodwill
COMMA
it
is
the
hard
work
of
staff
and
those
who
benefit
from
our
services
that
produces
the
kind
of
inspiring
results
I
see
every
day
:

A
Goodwill
staff
member
addresses
a
group
of
welfare
recipients
:

"
You
can
earn
the
money
to
support
yourself
and
your
family
COMMA
"
she
says
.

"
You
can
get
off
welfare
.

I
know
you
can
...
I
did
.
"

A
participant
in
a
Goodwill
program
rushes
back
from
a
job
interview
to
share
the
results
with
his
classmates
in
our
desktop
publishing
training
program
.

once
his
tears
have
subsided
COMMA
he
confirms
what
his
classmates
have
already
figured
out
:
he
just
received
a
job
offer
--
his
first
in
five
years
.

Addressing
a
meeting
at
a
neighborhood
center
COMMA
a
Goodwill
staff
member
tells
the
audience
how
Goodwill
can
help
them
find
and
keep
jobs
.

On
his
way
home
COMMA
he
shares
the
story
with
four
people
at
a
street
corner
.

At
the
next
corner
he
tells
five
more
.

In
order
to
develop
job
skills
COMMA
a
man
with
some
serious
disabilities
begins
working
in
Goodwill
's
industrial
division
.

It
takes
a
long
time
for
him
to
gain
the
self-confidence
to
work
elsewhere
in
the
community
.

Eventually
COMMA
he
turns
your
support
into
a
payoff
for
all
of
us
.

He
proudly
leaves
Goodwill
to
support
himself
.

These
people
and
their
successes
are
real
.

Just
like
the
respect
we
've
earned
from
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
.

Just
like
the
impact
Goodwill
's
work
has
on
our
community
.

Real
work
.

Real
results
.

A
real
difference
in
people
's
lives
--
in
all
of
our
lives
.

The
people
who
can
benefit
most
directly
from
your
generosity
have
no
time
to
waste
.

Neither
do
the
rest
of
us
who
feel
the
positive
results
of
their
success
.

Your
support
helps
provide
real
solutions
.

Please
use
the
enclosed
response
card
and
envelope
to
give
generously
to
Goodwill
today
.

COMMA

Dear
Mailhouse
donor
reminder
:

You
and
I
have
done
some
important
work
together
.

We
've
helped
people
break
free
of
the
welfare
cycle
.

We
've
found
ways
for
people
with
disabilities
to
enter
the
workforce
.

We
've
expanded
Goodwill
's
proven
methods
to
towns
and
neighborhoods
where
they
are
needed
most
.

Of
course
COMMA
we
've
played
different
roles
.

You
have
helped
make
Goodwill
's
work
possible
with
your
previous
support
.

Goodwill
has
devised
the
programs
that
turned
your
investment
into
results
.

Who
has
benefited
from
our
partnership
?

Everyone
has
.

When
you
and
I
help
somebody
find
a
job
COMMA
one
more
person
joins
the
ranks
of
tax
payers
COMMA
fewer
tax
dollars
are
spent
on
public
assistance
and
businesses
gain
another
consumer
.

There
are
a
lot
of
barriers
that
keep
people
from
working
:
physical
and
mental
disabilities
COMMA
history
of
welfare
dependency
and
lack
of
education
or
self-esteem
.

And
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
face
these
challenges
every
day
of
their
lives
.

So
our
work
must
continue
.

Everyone
benefits
from
the
work
we
do
together
.

Many
people
need
our
help
.

Please
continue
our
important
partnership
.

Support
Goodwill
with
a
generous
donation
today
.

COMMA

Dear
COMMA

Think
of
your
greatest
accomplishments
.

Think
of
the
joy
and
success
they
bring
to
you
and
your
loved
ones
.

Michael
Sims
felt
that
way
at
age
39
--
the
day
he
earned
a
job
.

Michael
was
born
with
cerebral
palsy
.

Upon
entering
the
work
force
COMMA
he
discovered
few
job
opportunities
that
seemed
to
match
his
abilities
.

For
several
years
he
performed
packaging
and
clerical
work
.

His
most
recent
job
lasted
only
a
year
before
cut-backs
eliminated
his
position
.

For
18
long
months
Michael
could
not
find
a
job
.

He
resorted
to
public
assistance
dollars
to
survive
.

Finally
COMMA
Michael
called
Goodwill
.

At
Goodwill
COMMA
Michael
's
counselors
felt
that
his
personable
demeanor
could
be
a
major
attribute
and
identified
for
him
a
possible
job-match
where
his
people
skills
could
shine
.

After
three
interviews
COMMA
Michael
proved
that
he
was
the
right
person
for
the
job
.

As
the
Clubhouse
Monitor
at
Bent
Tree
Apartments
COMMA
he
now
provides
customer
service
for
50
to
60
tenants
each
night
.

At
last
COMMA
he
has
found
success
in
a
job
that
he
loves
.

Now
his
goals
are
set
on
moving
up
in
the
company
.

Every
year
COMMA
thousands
of
people
come
to
Goodwill
.

Like
Michael
COMMA
they
share
two
common
characteristics
.

They
face
some
barrier
to
employment
and
they
want
to
work
.

With
support
from
people
like
you
COMMA
they
can
overcome
their
barriers
and
earn
success
and
the
self-sufficiency
that
comes
with
it
.

And
then
the
pay-off
begins
for
the
entire
community
.

Individual
successes
at
Goodwill
mean
fewer
persons
receiving
public
support
and
more
paying
taxes
.

Last
year
COMMA
participants
in
Goodwill
programs
earned
--
and
paid
taxes
on
--
wages
of
nearly
$
3.5
million
.

Their
successes
at
work
also
saved
taxpayers
more
than
three
-
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
in
public
assistance
.

The
savings
are
counted
in
more
ways
than
dollars
and
cents
COMMA
however
.

The
families
of
the
new
wage
earners
may
feel
the
accomplishment
in
terms
of
a
house
to
live
in
COMMA
money
to
purchase
food
--
without
food
stamps
--
and
the
beginning
of
a
family
focused
on
success
COMMA
not
hopelessness
.

Wo
n't
you
help
make
all
of
these
successes
possible
?

Please
send
the
largest
contribution
you
can
comfortably
make
.

Your
gift
will
help
give
new
meaning
to
the
word
success
--
for
people
who
have
seldom
had
reason
to
use
the
word
.

Sincerely
COMMA
James
M.
McClelland
President

Some
of
the
strongest
critics
of
our
welfare
system
are
the
people
who
have
become
dependent
on
it
.

Their
complaint
:
the
system
discourages
working
because
unemployment
provides
benefits
that
many
entry-level
jobs
do
n't
include
.

That
's
where
you
--
and
Goodwill
--
come
in
.

We
help
people
train
for
and
find
jobs
that
make
it
possible
for
them
to
get
off
of
welfare
.

Last
year
COMMA
Goodwill
placed
511
people
in
jobs
COMMA
more
than
double
the
number
we
placed
in
1993
.

While
the
debate
on
welfare
reform
is
gathering
like
a
storm
at
sea
COMMA
the
people
who
need
jobs
are
floundering
.

We
need
your
support
to
continue
getting
people
off
of
public
assistance
.

Welfare
is
not
the
answer
.

And
welfare
reform
is
an
uncertain
solution
with
an
unknown
starting
date
.

Goodwill
works
.

Right
now
.

Please
give
the
largest
gift
you
can
to
Goodwill
today
.

COMMA
Jack
Dustman

Dear
Friend
:

What
kind
of
people
benefit
by
your
contribution
to
Pleasant
Run
Children
's
Homes
?

Little
ones
COMMA
like
Baby
Jessica
COMMA
caught
in
the
struggle
between
adoptive
and
birth
parents
.

Older
kids
COMMA
like
Tracy
and
Kerry
COMMA
left
homeless
after
a
recent
murder-suicide
in
Indianapolis
claimed
Mom
and
Dad
.

Young
adults
COMMA
like
Mary
T.
COMMA
a
jobless
mother
of
three
COMMA
trying
desperately
to
keep
her
kids
out
of
trouble
in
a
crime
-
ridden
neighborhood
.

Real
people
!

There
are
thousands
more
.

Families
are
being
torn
apart
COMMA
and
too
often
COMMA
children
are
the
victims
.

Kids
like
Tommie
J.
COMMA
made
a
ward
of
the
court
because
of
repeated
beatings
by
an
alcoholic
father
;
Alice
COMMA
sent
to
a
group
home
to
get
help
because
of
severe
behavior
disorders
;
and
John
H.
COMMA
a
recovering
alcoholic
COMMA
rebuilding
a
relationships
with
his
family
so
they
can
live
together
again
.

Pleasant
Run
Children
's
Homes
began
serving
children
nearly
130
years
ago
.

Then
the
task
was
to
help
children
who
lost
parents
in
the
Civil
War
.

Today
COMMA
we
serve
children
and
families
with
a
multitude
of
problems
:
emotional
COMMA
physical
COMMA
psychological
and
sexual
abuse
.

Some
come
from
families
where
COMMA
through
therapy
COMMA
there
is
hope
for
reunification
.

For
others
COMMA
"
families
"
are
the
counselors
are
housemates
at
the
group
homes
where
they
live
.

The
biggest
tragedy
is
that
the
problems
do
n't
go
away
;
they
only
grow
.

In
1994
Pleasant
Run
served
346
children
and
125
families
.

In
1995
we
will
serve
over
850
children
and
340
families
.

In
1996
COMMA
these
figures
will
triple
.

The
children
and
families
who
come
to
Pleasant
Run
are
given
the
opportunity
to
become
happy
COMMA
loving
COMMA
and
productive
members
of
our
society
.

They
welcome
the
chance
to
belong
COMMA
to
become
self
-
sufficient
COMMA
to
regain
their
self-esteem
and
confidence
.

Often
it
is
a
long
COMMA
hard
struggle
COMMA
but
the
results
are
well
worth
it
.

For
Pleasant
Run
to
continue
to
serve
abused
and
neglected
children
and
their
families
COMMA
we
need
your
support
.

The
Funding
sources
are
shrinking
COMMA
but
the
needs
grow
explosively
.

Please
"
help
good
kids
get
better
"
by
sending
us
a
contribution
today
.

Your
gift
will
give
children
and
families
hope
for
improved
tomorrows
.

Dear
Friend
:

This
is
not
newsletter
.

It
is
a
fund
-
raising
appeal
.

But
there
's
no
reason
why
we
should
n't
share
good
news
at
the
same
time
.

Federal
COMMA
state
and
local
governments
are
freezing
or
withdrawing
much
-
needed
funding
sources
for
people
who
are
truly
in
need
.

In
spite
of
that
COMMA
Pleasant
Run
Children
's
Homes
COMMA
with
the
help
of
hundreds
of
volunteers
and
others
who
really
care
COMMA
continues
to
make
a
significant
impact
on
the
futures
of
families
and
kids
in
need
of
help
.

We
all
hear
about
today
's
increases
in
neglect
COMMA
abuse
and
abandonment
of
those
who
ca
n't
fight
back
:
children
.

Yet
few
of
us
hear
enough
about
kids
who
live
through
these
adversities
and
do
make
the
grade
.

The
positive
side
.

These
are
special
children
.

They
come
into
a
Pleasant
Run
program
...
whether
it
's
for
therapeutic
help
in
their
own
homes
(
which
nurtures
whole
families
)
COMMA
through
foster
care
families
or
in
the
familial
surroundings
of
our
residential
homes
.

For
some
COMMA
it
's
a
matter
of
weeks
or
months
;
for
others
COMMA
it
's
years
.

They
leave
Pleasant
Run
COMMA
generally
COMMA
ready
and
able
to
contribute
to
society
.

We
're
proud
of
our
children
and
all
that
they
overcome
.

We
are
a
not-for-profit
COMMA
multi-service
agency
.

We
would
n't
exist
if
the
need
were
n't
there
.

The
numbers
of
children
who
deserve
our
services
are
rising
...
as
quickly
as
our
programs
can
grow
to
serve
them
.

Please
help
us
help
them
.

Dear
Friends
of
Pleasant
Run
:

The
holiday
season
is
the
time
of
year
when
we
're
all
busy
buying
gifts
COMMA
baking
goodies
COMMA
decorating
our
homes
and
making
arrangements
to
be
with
family
and
friends
.

This
is
the
time
of
year
when
we
give
thanks
for
the
warmth
and
love
that
surrounds
us
.

And
this
time
of
year
is
an
occasion
to
remember
those
not
as
fortunate
as
we
are
.

Pleasant
Run
cares
for
at-risk
children
and
families
.

We
do
this
through
a
wide
range
of
programs
including
community
-
based
COMMA
therapeutic
foster
care
COMMA
group
homes
and
our
treatment
center
.

Many
of
the
children
are
victims
of
abuse
or
live
in
unstable
homes
.

Today
we
are
asking
you
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
consider
making
a
contribution
to
Pleasant
Run
to
help
the
1COMMA500
children
families
we
care
for
.

Many
of
the
children
have
no
homes
;
no
memories
of
joy
from
past
holidays
.

Others
are
from
families
that
are
struggling
to
provide
a
healthy
COMMA
happy
environment
but
do
n't
have
the
resources
to
make
it
possible
.

Your
contribution
will
make
a
difference
in
a
child
's
life
.

It
may
help
a
family
stay
together
.

It
can
certainly
make
happy
holiday
memories
.

A
gift
to
Pleasant
Run
means
the
children
in
our
care
will
have
presents
to
open
.

A
gift
means
a
family
will
have
a
holiday
meal
COMMA
cooking
utensils
to
prepare
the
meal
and
dishes
to
serve
it
on
.

Your
gift
will
go
beyond
the
holiday
season
.

It
can
help
purchase
clothing
COMMA
school
supplies
COMMA
books
and
educational
tools
throughout
the
year
.

Please
take
a
few
minutes
to
mail
a
donation
to
Pleasant
run
.

Let
our
families
and
children
know
that
you
want
them
to
have
the
same
kinds
of
memories
of
the
holidays
you
will
have
.

We
wish
you
and
your
family
a
new
year
full
of
joy
and
love
.

Sincerely
COMMA
Mary
Roth
Executive
Director

It
's
hard
to
believe
that
the
holiday
season
is
only
two
months
away
.

At
Pleasant
Run
COMMA
Inc.
we
are
making
plans
and
arrangements
for
our
children
and
families
.

Every
year
we
seek
companies
COMMA
organizations
and
individuals
to
sponsor
one
or
more
of
our
families
.

These
families
are
participants
in
our
community
-
based
programs
.

These
programs
focus
on
keeping
the
family
together
by
providing
counseling
and
other
services
to
the
entire
family
.

After
our
caseworkers
meet
with
these
families
and
their
children
they
often
find
they
lack
even
the
basic
necessities
such
as
cooking
utensils
COMMA
beds
COMMA
cleaning
supplies
COMMA
etc
.

We
meet
these
needs
immediately
.

But
COMMA
the
holiday
season
is
a
particularly
difficult
time
for
these
families
.

They
do
not
have
the
resources
necessary
to
purchase
gifts
or
food
for
a
holiday
meal
.

We
are
asking
you
to
consider
sponsoring
one
of
our
families
for
this
holiday
season
.

If
you
are
interested
and
would
like
more
information
COMMA
please
contact
Lisa
Lusk
or
Marcia
Whited
at
693-9222
.

We
would
like
to
have
families
matched
with
sponsors
no
later
than
xxxx
.

Thank
you
for
considering
this
opportunity
to
make
this
a
memorable
holiday
season
for
a
family
in
need
.

Sincerely
COMMA

Dear
Name
COMMA

What
a
Summer
!

And
we
're
just
getting
started
!

I
hope
you
'll
consider
continuing
your
support
of
Jameson
's
special
campers
by
renewing
your
last
gift
of
$
xxx
.

I
can
tell
you
we
need
your
help
now
as
much
as
ever
before
.

All
of
our
Six
summer
camping
sessions
are
booked
to
capacity
(
and
COMMA
truth
be
told
COMMA
with
maybe
one
our
two
extra
returning
campers
squeezed
in
)
and
we
have
a
waiting
list
of
60
children
who
are
hoping
to
come
if
a
spot
should
open
.

Many
more
camper
referrals
are
coming
from
new
organizations
such
as
school
social-workers
and
family
counseling
agencies
.

It
seems
summer
options
are
n't
readily
available
for
troubled
kids
whose
families
have
limited
incomes
COMMA
so
we
're
doing
all
we
can
to
make
Jameson
available
.

That
"
we
"
includes
the
Youth
Leadership
teens
.

These
60
or
so
campers
have
taken
on
a
fund
raiser
with
a
goal
of
raising
$
16COMMA000
for
camperships
.

Two
of
them
told
me
yesterday
that
as
a
group
they
decided
they
had
to
earn
the
right
to
ask
others
for
help
by
accomplishing
something
real
to
help
themselves
.

And
that
's
from
kids
many
people
see
as
a
problem
.

Even
after
the
summer
sessions
come
to
a
close
COMMA
Jameson
campers
will
take
part
in
year-round
programs
designed
to
keep
that
positive
contact
with
peers
and
role
models
alive
and
important
.

We
've
scheduled
more
than
15
follow-up
camper
weekends
beginning
in
September
and
going
around
till
next
summer
's
camping
season
.

Please
COMMA
consider
renewing
your
support
of
these
great
kids
today
.

Sincerely
COMMA

Dear
Mrs.
Name
COMMA

Confidence
.

An
understanding
that
COMMA
above
anything
else
COMMA
success
requires
genuine
effort
COMMA
a
willingness
to
set
challenging
goals
.

Caring
about
others
.

These
are
the
attributes
we
want
all
children
to
have
.

You
help
Jameson
campers
reach
for
them
.

If
these
special
children
are
to
become
the
adults
we
all
need
them
to
be
COMMA
we
have
to
lead
them
in
the
right
direction
right
now
.

Jameson
points
the
way
for
children
who
need
that
extra
hand
and
I
hope
you
'll
continue
your
support
this
year
.

Your
last
gift
of
$
50.00
helped
make
it
possible
for
us
to
provide
guidance
COMMA
encouragement
and
fun
to
nearly
400
Indianapolis
area
children
.

And
not
just
during
the
summer
COMMA
but
throughout
the
year
.

What
has
your
support
of
our
campers
meant
to
them
and
what
have
they
been
able
to
accomplish
because
you
care
?

The
best
indicator
I
can
give
you
of
the
positive
effect
our
year-round
contact
has
is
the
growth
in
and
deeds
of
the
Youth
Leadership
teens
.

In
just
the
past
few
years
this
program
has
grown
from
a
few
kids
and
a
few
extra
activities
to
a
team
of
almost
60
young
adults
taking
on
real
projects
.

YL
teens
will
make
J.C.
juniors
happen
again
this
year
for
7
and
8
year
old
campers
.

A
five
day
camp
COMMA
J.C.
juniors
introduces
at-risk
children
to
Jameson
two
years
earlier
than
we
could
previously
reach
them
.

That
means
we
now
have
the
opportunity
to
be
a
stable
COMMA
positive
and
important
part
of
each
child
's
life
for
an
entire
decade
.

The
teens
have
also
decided
to
raise
money
to
provide
camperships
for
other
campers
because
they
know
what
Jameson
has
meant
to
them
.

And
their
activities
are
n't
isolated
to
Jameson
.

The
teens
have
undertaken
a
volunteer
project
to
regularly
visit
with
sick
children
at
a
local
hospital
.

Please
consider
renewing
your
gift
today
.

The
kids
need
your
leadership
now
more
than
ever
.

If
you
can
increase
your
last
donation
COMMA
we
would
appreciate
that
show
of
support
for
the
campers
and
their
efforts
to
overcome
obstacles
and
create
successful
lives
.

Thank
you
again
for
helping
point
the
way
.

The
goal
of
MCCOY
COMMA
Inc.
has
been
to
make
a
difference
.

In
1998
COMMA
MCCOY
COMMA
Inc.
led
two
efforts
that
COMMA
we
believe
COMMA
will
help
our
community
continue
to
take
the
steps
necessary
to
help
all
young
people
grow
up
and
develop
well
.

Participants
in
the
Youth
Outcomes
Educational
Initiative
identified
three
goals
for
all
our
youth
to
obtain
:
economic
self-sufficiency
COMMA
healthy
family
COMMA
social
relationships
COMMA
and
involvement
in
the
community
.

A
short
time
later
COMMA
the
Community
Youth
Mapping
Project
sent
55
young
people
out
into
the
community
to
identify
the
resources
they
need
to
grow
up
well
:
caring
adults
COMMA
safe
places
to
go
COMMA
and
positive
things
to
do
.

One
group
of
adults
and
one
group
of
youth
COMMA
through
two
very
different
processes
COMMA
have
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
;
our
community
still
has
much
to
do
if
we
are
to
help
ALL
of
your
youth
successfully
develop
into
the
responsible
COMMA
productive
adults
who
will
our
community
in
the
future
.

As
a
provider
of
youth
services
COMMA
MCCOY
COMMA
Inc.
is
here
to
support
your
valuable
efforts
to
develop
young
people
.

Recently
COMMA
through
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
alliances
with
organizations
like
yours
COMMA
some
steps
have
been
taken
in
our
community
that
will
help
young
people
continue
to
be
involved
in
positive
activities
.

One
COMMA
IndyGo
in
April
adopted
a
much
-
needed
policy
that
all
young
people
under
the
age
of
19
may
ride
on
their
buses
at
half
the
normal
fare
all
year
long
.

Two
COMMA
funding
was
made
available
this
summer
for
youth
organizations
and
churches
to
conduct
positive
youth
programming
on
Saturday
evenings
.

Through
the
youth
mapping
process
COMMA
it
was
confirmed
that
the
positive
opportunities
for
youth
on
weekend
evenings
were
lacking
.

That
need
is
being
met
.

As
it
has
been
an
exciting
year
for
all
of
us
COMMA
MCCOY
COMMA
Inc.
can
not
do
its
part
without
the
support
of
organizations
like
yours
.

Annually
COMMA
we
ask
several
of
our
youth
serving
organizations
to
join
us
in
our
effort
to
help
young
people
grow
up
well
in
Indianapolis
.

Enclosed
is
a
donation
card
that
will
enable
you
to
make
Indianapolis
a
great
place
for
ALL
of
us
to
live
.

If
you
have
any
questions
or
concerns
at
any
time
COMMA
please
do
not
hesitate
to
call
me
at
921-1288

Its

is
to

and
cooperation
between
the
various
agencies
COMMA

COMMA
and
systems
that
serve
our
community

In

Dear
Name
:

In
the
summer
of
1993
COMMA
the
Marion
County
Commission
on
Youth
began
what
can
best
be
described
as
a
"
new
era
"
in
its
history
.

MCCOY
was
reorganized
as
an
independent
COMMA
not-for-profit
agency
COMMA
separate
from
local
government
.

It
retained
COMMA
however
COMMA
the
same
mission
with
which
it
had
been
charged
from
its
inception
:
to
serve
as
a
catalyst
for
effective
COMMA
coordinated
COMMA
and
collaborative
service
delivery
to
youth
in
our
community
.

For
the
past
three
years
COMMA
MCCOY
has
been
actively
engaged
in
accomplishing
this
declared
mission
in
cooperation
with
many
others
:
youth
service
providers
COMMA
youth
COMMA
funding
bodies
COMMA
and
interested
citizens
to
name
a
few
.

We
have
met
with
a
number
of
successes
along
the
way
COMMA
most
notably
the
Summer
Fun
Line
COMMA
the
Metro
Summer
Bus
Pass
COMMA
and
the
development
of
ten
neighborhood
youth
councils
.

A
Providers
Council
and
a
Youth
Coalition
are
building
relationships
that
will
hopefully
bear
great
fruit
in
the
years
to
come
.

The
formation
of
The
Community
Academy
COMMA
a
pilot
project
directed
at
expelled
students
from
local
school
systems
COMMA
has
come
about
as
a
result
of
MCCOY
's
efforts
to
mobilize
community
agencies
in
response
to
a
pressing
issue
.

McCoy
is
actively
represented
and
working
with
numerous
community
collaborations
where
we
regularly
raise
our
voice
to
speak
out
for
the
inclusion
of
young
people
in
both
decision-making
and
program
planning
processes
.

One
concrete
example
is
a
joint
project
undertaken
in
the
United
Northwest
Area
in
partnership
with
The
Junior
League
of
Indianapolis
and
Community
Partnerships
with
Youth
from
Fort
Wayne
COMMA
Indiana
.

As
a
team
COMMA
these
three
organizations
are
working
with
neighborhood
youth
and
adults
to
build
a
"
Caring
Neighborhood
with
Youth
"
COMMA
mobilizing
the
assets
of
young
people
and
adults
as
partners
to
build
a
better
neighborhood
for
all
.

Since
its
re-organization
COMMA
MCCOY
has
established
its
unique
niche
within
the
community
by
refraining
from
direct
service
programming
and
focusing
on
what
it
does
best
:
helping
to
identify
youth
needs
COMMA
convening
groups
of
individuals
and
organizations
which
can
address
those
needs
COMMA
and
moving
toward
collaborative
solutions
.

McCoy
has
only
one
interest
:
the
well
being
of
Marion
County
's
young
people
.

McCoy
invites
the
support
of
The
__
Company
Foundation
in
the
amount
of
$
10COMMA000.00
to
support
such
activities
as
:
----
the
co-ordination
of
youth
leadership
training
and
youth
empowerment
efforts
at
the
neighborhood
level
by
means
of
neighborhood
-
based
youth
councils
;
----
the
promotion
of
youth
employment
opportunities
;
----
the
facilitation
of
ongoing
discussions
regarding
effective
and
efficient
youth
service
delivery
;
----
the
provision
of
technical
assistance
and
guidance
to
neighborhoods
which
seek
positive
youth
-
adult
relationships
;
----
the
development
of
community
-
wide
supports
for
the
positive
growth
of
all
Marion
County
young
people
.

In
the
last
several
years
COMMA
the
business
and
corporate
community
has
recognized
that
the
positive
development
of
youth
is
directly
related
to
the
development
of
a
competent
workforce
.

Youth
who
are
supported
and
encouraged
by
both
a
family
and
a
society
that
values
Them
have
a
much
greater
likelihood
of
becoming
productive
and
contributing
members
of
adult
society
.

While
we
have
made
significant
inroads
COMMA
there
remains
much
to
be
done
and
it
is
clear
that
we
can
not
do
it
alone
.

We
seek
the
financial
support
of
the
Foundation
to
help
us
be
successful
in
creating
the
atmosphere
in
our
community
where
young
people
can
grow
and
develop
well
.

Your
contribution
will
enable
us
to
both
continue
and
expand
the
good
work
we
have
begun
in
making
Indianapolis
a
city
famous
for
its
commitment
to
youth
and
families
.

In
our
fund
raising
efforts
to
date
COMMA
we
have
received
the
support
of
local
government
COMMA
foundations
COMMA
and
corporations
as
well
as
the
personal
financial
commitments
of
individual
MCCOY
Board
members
.

We
believe
there
is
no
more
appropriate
time
to
have
a
coordinated
and
collaborative
effort
to
financially
support
the
services
MCCOY
offers
to
the
community
as
a
whole
.

Thanking
you
in
advance
for
your
support
COMMA
we
remain

Dear
Friend
:

Adolescence
.

It
is
a
pivotal
time
in
the
life
of
a
young
girl
-
when
small
changes
in
her
behavior
COMMA
or
the
choices
she
makes
COMMA
can
affect
her
future
.

It
's
hard
enough
for
her
to
make
good
decisions
when
she
's
surrounded
by
support
.

It
's
even
harder
when
she
is
n't
.

Big
Sisters
helps
fill
that
void
by
matching
caring
COMMA
responsible
adult
volunteers
with
at-risk
girls
COMMA
ages
8
-
14
.

A
Big
Sister
is
a
mentor
COMMA
a
friend
and
a
role
model
COMMA
helping
a
young
girl
to
develop
the
self-confidence
and
life
skills
necessary
to
become
a
responsible
COMMA
productive
and
successful
adult
.

Your
$
1COMMA000
contribution
can
put
a
mentor
in
a
child
's
life
-
and
hope
in
a
child
's
future
.

The
results
of
an
18
-
month
study
completed
by
Public
/
Private
Ventures
showed
that
children
participating
in
one
-
to
-
one
Big
Sister
and
Big
Brother
matches
for
just
one
year
COMMA
reduced
first
time
drug
use
by
46
%
;
lowered
school
absenteeism
by
52
%
;
cut
aggressive
behavior
by
33
%
;
enhanced
school
performance
;
and
improved
relations
with
family
and
friends
.

This
is
positive
proof
that
Big
Sisters
one
-
to
-
one
mentoring
program
helps
change
lives
.

Today
COMMA
we
are
offering
you
the
opportunity
to
help
change
a
life
.

By
contributing
$
1COMMA000
you
can
support
one
match
for
one
year
.

This
money
maintains
the
infrastructure
that
fosters
and
supports
the
development
of
effective
relationships
.

This
includes
a
volunteer
screening
process
COMMA
orientation
COMMA
training
and
ongoing
supervision
and
support
by
a
professional
staff
.

As
a
Matchmaker
you
will
receive
a
description
of
"
your
match
"
and
be
identified
as
a
Matchmaker
on
a
plaque
in
the
Big
Sisters
office
COMMA
in
the
agency
newsletter
and
annual
report
.

Today
Big
Sisters
serves
over
1COMMA000
girls
in
central
Indiana
.

But
for
each
girl
served
COMMA
more
are
left
unserved
.

Over
235
girls
are
currently
waiting
for
a
Big
Sister
.

Imagine
the
difference
the
community
could
make
if
each
congregation
pledged
its
support
of
one
Big
Sisters
match
!

I
encourage
you
to
Join
me
in
presenting
this

"
The
urgency

the

be
made

Do
not

Do
not

Understand
the
world
and
change
it
where
it
needs

You
can
help
make
positive
changes
in
the
lives
of
at-risk
youth
in
central
Indiana
.

We
often
hear
about
economic
poverty
COMMA
but
what
some
of
these
young
people
are
growing
up
with
is
emotional
poverty
-
they
have
often
given
up
on
hope
and
the
possibility
of
a
successful
future
.

With
your
help
COMMA
we
can
change
that
.

Many
Little
Sisters
are
preparing
to
go
back
to
school
this
fall
full
of
hope
and
with
a
positive
outlook
.

Thanks
to
our
Big
Sisters
volunteers
COMMA
these
young
people
are
self
-
confident
COMMA
believe
in
themselves
and
are
beginning
to
realize
their
full
potential
.

A
recent
study
by
Public

(

showed
that
girls
who
had
a
Big

for
just

is
a
testament
to
the
Big

program
.

"
I
was
matched
with
my
Big
Sister
in
June
of
1992
.

Since
then
COMMA
she
and
I
have
grown
very
close
and
I
have
been
able
to
experience
lots
of
new
things
.

We
go
to
movies
COMMA
dinner
COMMA
concerts
COMMA
and
other
stuff
like
that
COMMA
but
I
have
also
been
able
to
participate
in
charity
events
and
fundraiser
type
things
.

Not
only
did
I
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
my
Big
Sister
COMMA
but
I
learned
a
lot
from
her
too
.

I
have
become
more
open-minded
COMMA
more
responsible
COMMA
and
COMMA
most
importantly
COMMA
I
have
gained
a
lot
more
self-confidence
.

I
am
very
thankful
to
the
Big
Sisters
program
for
allowing
me
this
very
special
opportunity
.

In
1998
COMMA
Big
Sisters
served
972
young
people
through
its
many
programs
.

But
the
need
is
still
great
.

Over
170
young
people
are
still
waiting
for
a
mentor
.

You
are
an
important
part
in
making
sure
these
young
people
are
matched
with
caring
adult
mentors
.

Will
you
make
a
financial
gift
to
Big
Sisters
in
1999
that
will
ensure
that
more
young
people
receive
the
guidance
they
need
COMMA
that
more
young
people
stay
in
school
COMMA
stay
off
drugs
and
make
good
choices
?

Your
contribution
will
be
used
to
recruit
and
retain
quality
volunteers
.

It
will
also
be
used
to
help
maintain
the
infrastructure
that
fosters
and
supports
the
development
of
effective
relationships
COMMA
including
volunteer
orientation
and
training
and
ongoing
supervision
and
support
by
a
professional

.

This
year
your
gift
can
go
farther
!

Gifts
of

100
or
more
will
be
matched
thanks
to

Dear
Name
:

The
1999
Invest
in
Youth
Campaign
is
in
full
swing
.

As
a
former
board
member
COMMA
the
success
of
the
YMCA
is
still
important
to
me
.

We
must
be
able
to
reach
all
youth
and
families
interested
in
values
-
based
programs
.

The
Invest
in
Youth
campaign
helps
insure
this
.

New
initiatives
in
the
inner
-
city
are
taking
hold
.

The
Urban
Mission
Branch
is
reaching
out
to
middle
school
youth
with
programs
based
on
caring
COMMA
honesty
COMMA
respect
and
responsibility
for
themselves
and
others
.

For
some
COMMA
these
are
very
different
messages
from
the
ones
heard
in
the
street
.

They
are
learning
to
make
positive
choices
concerning
alcohol
COMMA
tobacco
and
other
drugs
and
to
support
each
other
when
those
choices
are
challenged
.

You
have
shared
in
the
vision
and
the
leadership
of
the
YMCA
of
Greater
Indianapolis
.

I
now
invite
you
to
continue
to
support
the
mission
and
the
message
that
is
so
important
to
building
strong
kids
COMMA
strong
families
and
strong
communities
.

Please
consider
joining
the
Chairman
's
Roundtable
with
a
gift
of
$
1COMMA000
.

I
have
enclosed
a
pledge
card
for
your
convenience
.

We
would
like
to
announce
the
success
of
this
year
's
campaign
at
the
Annual
Meeting
on
April
27
COMMA
so
please
return
your
pledge
or
gift
within
the
next
30
days
.

Thank
you
.

Even

"

"

Chatterbox
feels
that
the

charges
against

(

well
as

column
in

)
cries
out
for
the
introduction
of
the
Scientific
Method
into
the
usually
mushy
business
of
assessing
press
responsibility
.

With
that
in
mind
COMMA
Chatterbox
hereby
inaugurates
the
Intellectual
Dishonesty
(
henceforth
to
be
known
as
the
Indis
)
Index
.

Here
's
how
it
works
:

Publications
that
refuse
to
acknowledge
(
even
if
to
refute
the
importance
of
)
highly
significant
but
inconvenient
facts
in
their
news
or
opinion
coverage
of
controversial
events
will
score
one
point
for
the
initial
offense
.

They
will
then
score
one
point
for
every
subsequent
issue
or
broadcast
or
Internet
posting
after
the
first
offense
is
noted
by
Chatterbox
if
they
continue
not
to
report
said
inconvenient
fact
--
and
an
additional
two
points
on
days
when
the
news
organization
runs
a
follow-up
without
making
note
of
said
inconvenient
fact
.

Publications
receiving
a
score
of
10
will
be
inducted
into
the
Indis
Hall
of
Fame
.

Publications
that
get
all
the
way
up
to
20
will
be
faxed
a
likeness
of
Joseph
Stalin
.

(
Chatterbox
would
prefer
not
to
invoke
the
phrase
"
intellectual
dishonesty
COMMA
"
because
it
's
pompous
and
falsely
suggests
that
only
intellectuals
can
be
intellectually
dishonest
.

But
Chatterbox
does
n't
know
any
other
easily
understandable
phrase
that
describes
this
particular
kind
of
offense
.
)

For
the
purposes
of
this
survey
COMMA
the
Wall
Street
Journal
will
be
counted
as
a
separate
and
distinct
publication
from
the
Journal
's
editorial
page
COMMA
because
COMMA
in
essence
COMMA
it
is
.

The
Journal
editorial
page
continues
not
to
acknowledge
that

Broaddrick
who
is
one
of
two
people
partially
corroborating
Broaddrick
's
rape
accusation
COMMA
is
the
daughter
of
a
man
whose
murderer
was
pardoned
by
Gov.
Bill
Clinton
.

(
A
responsible
account
of
the
whole
controversy
in
today
's
New
York
Times
reports
that
Kelsey
says
the
pardon
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
corroboration
.
)

The
Journal
editorial
page
gets
one
point
for
failing
to
note
the
pardon
in
its
initial
Op-Ed
by
Dorothy
Rabinowitz
on
Feb.
19
.

Because
it
has
published
three
times
since
the
initial
omission
COMMA
it
scores
an
additional
three
points
.

And
because
it
published
an
editorial
Feb.
22
taunting
the
rest
of
the
press
for
not
following
it
on
the
story
--
and
still
did
n't
mention
the
pardon
--
it
scores
an
extra
two
points
.

That
comes
to
a
total
of
six
.

Chatterbox
feels
certain
that
the
Journal
editorial
page
will
provide
some
follow-up
tomorrow
to
tonight
's
NBC
broadcast
of
its
own
Broaddrick
interview
COMMA
which
means
that
if
the
Journal
editorial
page
continues
to
take
no
action
it
will
be
in
the
Indis
Hall
of
Fame
by
Monday
at
the
latest
!

Chatterbox
considered
but
rejected
the
idea
of
awarding
Rabinowitz
bonus
points
for
having
"
eventually
convinced
"
Broaddrick
to
grant
an
interview
to
the
New
York
Times
(
as
the
Times
reports
in
today
's
story
)
.

But
the
Scientific
Method
does
not
permit
any
tinkering
with
the
Indis
Index
's
scoring
procedures
.

And
besides
COMMA
Rabinowitz
's
efforts
on
the
Times
'
behalf
were
n't
really
unethical
COMMA
just
puzzling
COMMA
given
the
two
newspapers
'
intense
rivalry
.

When
Chatterbox
asked
the
Journal
's
DC
bureau
chief
COMMA
Alan
Murray
COMMA
who
exercised
good
judgment
in
not
breaking
the
Broaddrick
story
(
and
--
full
disclosure
--
is
Chatterbox
's
former
boss
)
COMMA
to
comment
about
a
Journal
employee
's
feeding
sources
to
the
Times
COMMA
he
replied
:
"
I
do
n't
really
have
any
comment
on
what
the
edit
page
did
.
They
do
their
thing
COMMA
we
do
ours
.
"
Which
is
what
Journal
news
employees
are
instructed
to
say
whenever
the
editorial
page
causes
them
cringing
embarrassment
.

For
her
part
COMMA
Rabinowitz
explains
to
Chatterbox
that
her
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
Times
were
more
indifferent
than
the
Times
made
them
sound
.

"
Ms.
Broaddrick
told
me
Sunday
that
a
Times
reporter
had
appeared
at
the
house
in
the
a.
m.
COMMA
and
that
she
had
refused
an
interview
COMMA
"
Rabinowitz
writes
in
an
e-mail
message
.

"
I
asked
her
why
she
had
decided
to
talk
to
the
New
York
Post
'
s
Steve
Dunleavy
COMMA
and
refused
a
Times
reporter
.

She
said
Dunleavy
caught
her
by
surprise
.

She
asked
if
I
thought
it
would
be
all
right
to
talk
to
the
Times
reporter
.

I
told
her
it
would
be
--
certainly
as
all
right
as
talking
to
Dunleavy
.

She
said
COMMA
'
Well
COMMA
I
'm
sorry
I
did
n't
.
'

She
said
she
would
if
he
called
again
.

I
passed
this
on
to
-LSB-
Times
reporter
-RSB-
Felicity
Barringer
during
our
second
day
's
interview
chat
.

So
--
that
's
how
it
happens
that
in
the
New
York
Times
piece
today
I
'm
described
--
solemnly
--
as
having
'
eventually
convinced
'
her
to
repeat
the
story
to
the
New
York
Times
.

No
More
Kisses

In
light
of
Secretary
of
State
Albright
's
imminent
trip
to
the
middle
east
COMMA
the
New
York
Times
COMMA
Los
Angeles
Times
and
Washington
Post
emphasize
the
deteriorating
situation
there
.

But
USA
Today
stays
with
Princess
Di
.

The
NYT
states
that
when
Albright
shows
up
on
Tuesday
COMMA
she
will
"
read
the
riot
act
"
to
Yassir
Arafat
about
cracking
down
on
terrorism
.

Her
goal
will
be
to
get
Arafat
to
come
out
decisively
and
publicly
for
peace
with
Israel
COMMA
telling
him
that
there
can
be
no
more
attempts
at
co-opting
Hamas
COMMA
and
"
no
more
kisses
"
of
its
leaders
.

The
Times
emphasizes
the
larger
geopolitical
context
.

Given
that
the
troubles
on
the
West
Bank
have
not
only
frosted
relations
between
Arafat
and
Israel
COMMA
but
also
those
between
Israel
and
Egypt
and
between
Israel
and
Saudi
Arabia
COMMA
the
paper
states
that
the
U.S.
is
now
facing
the
prospect
that
the
moderate
Arab
coalition
it
built
after
the
Persian
Gulf
war
to
contain
Iraq
and
Iran
is
falling
apart
.

The
LAT
focuses
on
new
dissension
within
the
Israeli
government
about
whether
or
not
Israel
should
continue
to
maintain
forces
in
southern
Lebanon
COMMA
dissension
fueled
when
an
Israeli
commando
raid
there
late
last
week
was
ambushed
COMMA
with
twelve
deaths
the
result
.

Perhaps
the
most
striking
indicator
of
a
change
of
mood
inside
the
government
reported
by
the
paper
is
the
news
that
cabinet
member
Ariel
Sharon
COMMA
who
as
Defense
Minister
in
1982
got
Israel
entrenched
in
Lebanon
in
the
first
place
COMMA
is
among
those
urging
a
reconsideration
of
the
deployment
.

Several
papers
have
word
that
H
and
R
Block
has
finally
wriggled
out
of
its
controlling
stake
of
Compuserve
COMMA
but
it
's
the
Post
with
the
news
that
AOL
is
set
to
take
it
over
.

The
Wall
Street
Journal
"
Outlook
"
observes
COMMA
"
In
the
U.S.
job
market
COMMA
the
balance
of
power
is
shifting
to
employees
from
employers
COMMA
"
and
states
that
"
the
retention
frenzy
was
triggered
in
part
by
previous
waves
of
corporate
downsizing
COMMA
"
which
left
behind
survivors
who
took
stock
of
career
options
and
used
Internet
job
listings
and
intensified
recruiting
to
land
better
offers
COMMA
which
in
turn
led
to
counter-offers
and
higher
salaries
.

This
has
led
COMMA
says
the
Journal
COMMA
to
annual
compensation
rising
5
-
6
percent
a
year
.

Much
of
the
continuing
Diana
coverage
is
spinning
off
into
the
realm
of
meta
-
and
meta-meta-pieces
.

The
LAT
COMMA
for
instance
COMMA
examines
what
it
takes
to
be
a
new
"
cuddly
-
feely
"
Britain
born
of
the
national
grief
experience
.

But
USAT
and
the
WP
also
each
run
pretty
newsy
Diana
pieces
as
well
.

Both
reveal
that
Tony
Blair
had
conferred
with
Diana
about
a
goodwill
ambassador
job
shortly
before
her
death
COMMA
and
USAT
reports
that
Le
Figaro
says
a
dying
Diana
gave
two
crash
witnesses
a
message
for
her
family
and
children
.

Give
the
NYT
credit
for
getting
Mother
Teresa
back
on
the
front
page
and
a
bonus
point
for
including
some
criticism
of
her
in
the
story
.

"
Not
everyone
in
Calcutta
COMMA
or
India
for
that
matter
COMMA
is
unanimous
in
praising
the
nun
COMMA
whose
organization
was
able
to
raise
millions
of
dollars
worldwide
but
made
virtually
no
significant
changes
in
the
social
structure
of
this
collapsing
city
's
poor
neighborhoods
.

Salvation
--
hers
and
that
of
the
destitute
she
rescued
from
the
gutters
--
was
her
aim
COMMA
not
economic
or
social
development
as
many
others
understand
it
COMMA
she
said
.
"

It
's
odd
COMMA
however
COMMA
that
in
repeating
this
charge
COMMA
the
Times
did
n't
interview
the
man
most
closely
associated
with
it
COMMA
Christopher
Hitchens
COMMA
or
refer
to
the
book
where
he
set
it
out
COMMA
The
Missionary
Position
.

Hmmm
COMMA
wan
na
bet
there
was
a
copy
of
the
book
on
somebody
's
desk
at
the
Times
though
?

What
's
with
the
top-of-the-front
headline
the
LAT
puts
over
its
picture
of
Martina
Hingis
standing
next
to
Venus
Williams
after
beating
her
at
the
U.S.
Open
--
"
Venus
Brought
Back
to
Earth
"
?

Does
n't
that
sound
like
celebrating
a
defeat
rather
than
celebrating
a
victory
?

How
odd
--
and
a
good
illustration
of
how
trying
to
shoe-horn
in
a
"
witty
"
headline
can
drive
you
into
an
idea
that
does
n't
fit
or
is
undeserved
.

Given
that
Ms.
Williams
'
parents
are
rather
protective
of
her
and
that
she
is
a
black
in
a
still
pretty
-
lilly
-
white
sport
COMMA
do
n't
be
surprised
if
there
's
a
bit
of
a
complaint
about
this
.

Fashioning
Paula

USA
Today
leads
with
Texas
'
settlement
of
its
product
-
liability
lawsuit
against
the
leading
tobacco
companies
.

The
top
nonlocal
story
at
the
Washington
Post
is
the
latest
development
in
the
Indonesian
economic
crisis
--
a
rare
and
boosterish
Suharto
press
conference
in
contrast
to
a
further
plunging
stock
market
and
food
riots
in
outlying
towns
.

The
New
York
Times
leads
with
a
comprehensive
poll
about
American
attitudes
concerning
abortion
.

In
the
Texas
case
COMMA
reports
USAT
COMMA
the
defendant
companies
have
agreed
to
pay
about
$
15
billion
over
25
years
to
reimburse
the
state
for
expenses
it
incurred
in
the
treatment
of
smoking
-
related
illnesses
.

That
makes
Texas
the
third
state
to
settle
such
a
case
COMMA
joining
Florida
and
Mississippi
.

There
are
COMMA
says
the
paper
COMMA
a
total
of
40
such
suits
on
file
COMMA
with
Minnesota
's
turn
coming
next
week
.

The
Wall
Street
Journal
states
that
the
plaintiffs
'
lawyers
hired
by
Texas
to
try
the
case
will
receive
as
part
of
the
deal
almost
$
2.2
billion
in
fees
.

The
NYT
abortion
survey
COMMA
the
first
conducted
by
the
paper
since
1989
COMMA
was
based
on
telephone
interviews
of
1COMMA101
people
and
detects
"
a
notable
shift
from
general
acceptance
"
of
having
the
procedure
:
from
40
percent
to
32
percent
.

And
the
pollsters
also
detected
an
increasingly
acute
sensitivity
to
abortion
timing
:

Sixty-one
percent
of
those
polled
thought
abortions
should
be
permitted
during
the
first
trimester
COMMA
but
only
15
percent
in
the
second
and
just
7
percent
in
the
third
.

(
The
piece
notes
that
this
last
stat
helps
explain
why
a
focus
on
partial
-
birth
abortions
has
proven
politically
advantageous
for
abortion
foes
.
)

Nearly
45
percent
of
those
asked
to
state
the
present
law
on
abortion
could
not
give
the
correct
answer
.

The
WSJ
notes
that
the
just
-
concluded
football
/
TV
deal
will
probably
mean
even
steeper
cable
bills
in
the
near
future
.

Some
local
cable
companies
COMMA
the
paper
says
COMMA
expect
the
fees
they
'll
pay
ESPN
to
go
up
more
than
20
percent
.

And
they
're
in
the
habit
of
passing
expenses
along
to
Joe
Remote
.

Even
non
-
sports
fans
will
be
affected
COMMA
notes
the
Journal
COMMA
because
ESPN
is
usually
part
of
basic
cable
service
.

the
question

The

that

according
to
an
MIT
survey
COMMA
Americans
are
twice
as
likely
to
back
a
tax
increase
going
toward
the
search
for
extraterrestrials
than
one
for

research
.

The
NYT
reports
that
today
's
issue
of
the
journal
Science
will
describe
an
experiment
in
which
people
's
biological
clocks
were
reset
three
hours
by
shining
a
bright
light
on
the
back
of
their
knees
.

The
finding
COMMA
if
it
holds
up
COMMA
says
the
Times
COMMA
may
lead
to
a
simple
way
for
airline
travelers
to
fight
jet
lag
.

Yesterday
's
Los
Angeles
Times
ran
a
story
under
the
headline
"
Paula
Jones
Works
on
Her
Court
Appearance
COMMA
"
which
COMMA
illustrated
by
pictures
of
Jones
COMMA
was
all
about
the
various
looks
she
's
had
since
stepping
on
the
public
stage
.

The
piece
concluded
that
she
's
finally
graduated
to
an
image
that
's
"
sophisticated
yet
soft
.
"

Today
's
WP
"
Style
"
section
(
that
's
the
opposite
of
substance
COMMA
remember
)
picks
up
that
ball
and
runs
with
it
COMMA
with
a
lengthy
discourse
on
the
new
PJ
.

"
It
is
COMMA
"
hyperventilates
the
Post
COMMA
one
of
the
most
jaw
-
dropping
public
make-overs
ever
.
"

Jones
apparently
has
"
smoothed
the
frizzy
mane
of
curls
that
once
reached
to
such
dazzling
heights
.

Her
makeup
is
now
subtle
and
based
on
natural
COMMA
not
neon
COMMA
hues
.

Her
clothing
is
inspired
by
the
boardroom
instead
of
the
secretarial
pool
.

She
has
embraced
the
markers
of
dignity
COMMA
refinement
and
power
.
"

In
true
newspaper
overkill
fashion
COMMA
the
piece
backs
this
up
by
consulting
Cynde
Watson
COMMA
national
makeup
artist
for
Bobbi
Brown
Essentials
COMMA
and
Steven
Zdatny
COMMA
a
historian
at
West
Virginia
University
specializing
in
the
aesthetics
and
politics
of
hair
.

The
placement
of
these
two
pieces
is
a
PR
triumph
COMMA
but
one
carrying
the
seeds
of
its
own
destruction
:

If
people
know
all
this
work
is
going
into
making
Paula
Jones
seem
a
certain
someone
COMMA
does
n't
that
just
make
it
obvious
that
she
's
really
somebody
else
?

Stephanopoulos
Analyzes
His
Own
Crime

There
was
former
Clinton
aide
George
Stephanopoulos
on
ABC
's
This
Week
this
morning
COMMA
furrow-browed
and
"
heartbroken
with
all
the
evidence
coming
out
"
against
the
president
.

Last
week
COMMA
when
the
Lewinsky
story
was
only
a
few
hours
old
COMMA
Stephanopoulos
popped
up
on
Good
Morning
America
to
demonstrate
his
concern
.

"
These
are
probably
the
most
serious
allegations
yet
leveled
against
the
president
.

There
's
no
question
that
COMMA
if
they
're
true
COMMA
they
...
could
lead
to
impeachment
proceedings
.
"

Is
Chatterbox
alone
in
thinking
there
is
something
strange
and
even
disgusting
about
Stephanopoulos
'
eager
show
of
independence
from
the
president
?

The
problem
is
n't
so
much
his
disloyalty
.

Political
figures
turn
on
each
other
from
time
to
time
COMMA
for
good
and
bad
reasons
;

we
're
used
to
it
.

Stephanopoulos
wants
to
run
for
the
Senate
and
does
n't
want
to
seem
a
Clinton
stooge
.

By
lending
credence
to
the
Lewinsky
charges
COMMA
and
treating
Clinton
's
familiar
defenses
as
the
lies
and
half
-
lies
they
seem
to
be
COMMA
Stephanopoulos
shows
he
's
not
a
fool
.

The
trouble
is
that
Stephanopoulos
himself
helped
propagate
those
lies
in
the
first
place
.

During
the
1992
campaign
COMMA
when
Gennifer
Flowers
first
brought
Clinton
's
philandering
to
public
attention
COMMA
Stephanopoulos
--
as
Clinton
's
chief
spinner
COMMA
distracter
COMMA
and
all
-
around
bullshit
artist
--
played
a
crucial
role
in
discrediting
Flowers
and
anyone
else
who
tried
to
point
out
the
truth
COMMA
namely
that
Clinton
had
a
disturbing
zipper
problem
.

(
Do
n't
say
Stephanopoulos
did
n't
know
.

Again
COMMA
he
's
not
a
fool
.
)

Simply
put
COMMA
Stephanopoulos
did
as
much
as
any
man
to
get
the
country
into
the
mess
he
now
so
telegenically
laments
.

The
1993
documentary
The
War
Room
captures
some
of
his
efforts
on
tape
.

Early
in
the
film
COMMA
with
the
Flowers
crisis
in
full
bloom
COMMA
Sam
Donaldson
interviews
Stephanopoulos
COMMA
who
blames
it
all
on
the
"
Republican
attack
machine
.
"

"
Gov.
Clinton
has
no
character
problem
COMMA
"
Stephanopoulos
declares
.

Donaldson
suggests
that
on
60
Minutes
Clinton
had
admitted
to
infidelity
.

"
He
said
he
had
problems
in
his
marriage
COMMA
"
says
Stephanopoulos
COMMA
correcting
Donaldson
's
deviation
from
the
pre-scripted
fudge
-
phrase
of
the
day
.

(
Today
COMMA
of
course
COMMA
the
president
's
defenders
claim
that
Clinton
admitted
infidelity
on
60
Minutes
and
that
the
fully
informed
voters
simply
did
n't
care
.
)

Near
the
end
of
The
War
Room
COMMA
Stephanopoulos
gets
a
call
from
someone
who
apparently
claims
to
have
a
list
of
Clinton
paramours
COMMA
which
he
is
about
to
publicize
.

Stephanopoulos
skillfully
bullies
and
cajoles
him
into
keeping
quiet
.

"
You
would
be
laughed
at
...
"
he
tells
the
caller
.

"
I
guarantee
you
that
if
you
do
this
you
'll
never
work
in
Democratic
politics
again
...
.

Nobody
will
believe
you
and
people
will
think
you
're
scum
.
"

You
might
say
that
Stephanopoulos
helped
invent
the
philander
-
protection
techniques
that
seem
to
have
made
Clinton
so
overconfident
of
his
ability
to
not
get
caught
.

He
was
one
of
Clinton
's
principal
enablers
COMMA
to
use
a
word
employed
by
Maureen
Dowd
in
today
's
New
York
Times
.

When
Democrats
wonder
why
there
is
so
much
resentment
of
Clinton
COMMA
they
do
n't
need
to
look
much
further
than
the
Big
Lie
about
philandering
that
Stephanopoulos
COMMA
Carville
(
and
a
cooperative
campaign
press
corps
)
helped
to
put
over
in
1992
.

Now
the
dissembler
and
enabler
has
become
the
scholar
and
ABC
News
analyst
.

It
's
as
if
Roy
Cohn
went
on
television
in
the
mid-'50s
to
soberly
rue
the
damage
wreaked
by
Sen.
Joe
McCarthy
COMMA
without
any
apology
for
his
own
role
.

Much
has
been
made
of
the
way
famous
wrongdoers
(
e.
g.
:
Dick
Morris
COMMA
Marv
Albert
)
rebound
too
quickly
in
our
celebrity
culture
.

But
usually
at
least
a
nanosecond
of
contrition
is
required
.

Stephanopoulos
is
cashing
in
without
even
going
through
the
minimal
motions
of
holding
himself
accountable
for
misleading
the
country
.

If
Clinton
COMMA
as
is
now
increasingly
clear
COMMA
was
a
time
bomb
waiting
to
explode
COMMA
then
Stephanopoulos
helped
smuggle
him
into
the
White
House
and
muffled
the
ticking
.

In
American
romance
COMMA
almost
nothing
rates
higher
than
what
the
movie
men
have
called
``
meeting
cute
''
--
that
is
COMMA
boy
-
meets
-
girl
seems
more
adorable
if
it
does
n't
take
place
in
an
atmosphere
of
correct
and
acute
boredom
.

Just
about
the
most
enthralling
real-life
example
of
meeting
cute
is
the
Charles
MacArthur
-
Helen
Hayes
saga
:
reputedly
all
he
did
was
give
her
a
handful
of
peanuts
COMMA
but
he
said
simultaneously
COMMA
``
I
wish
they
were
emeralds
''
.

Aside
from
the
comico-romantico
content
here
COMMA
a
good
linguist
-
anthropologist
could
readily
pick
up
a
few
other
facts
COMMA
especially
if
he
had
a
little
more
of
the
conversation
to
go
on
.

The
way
MacArthur
said
his
line
--
if
you
had
the
recorded
transcript
of
a
professional
linguist
--
would
probably
have
gone
like
this
:
A[fj]
Primary
stresses
on
emeralds
and
wish
;
note
pitch
3
(
pretty
high
)
on
emeralds
but
with
a
slight
degree
of
drawl
COMMA
one
degree
of
oversoftness
.

Conclusions
:
The
people
involved
(
and
subsequent
facts
bear
me
out
here
)
knew
clearly
the
relative
values
of
peanuts
and
emeralds
COMMA
both
monetary
and
sentimental
.

And
the
drawling
COMMA
oversoft
voice
of
flirtation
COMMA
though
fairly
overt
COMMA
was
still
well
within
the
prescribed
gambit
of
their
culture
.

In
other
words
COMMA
like
automation
machines
designed
to
work
in
tandem
COMMA
they
shared
the
same
programming
COMMA
a
mutual
understanding
not
only
of
English
words
COMMA
but
of
the
four
stresses
COMMA
pitches
COMMA
and
junctures
that
can
change
their
meaning
from
black
to
white
.

At
this
point
COMMA
unfortunately
COMMA
romance
becomes
a
regrettably
small
part
of
the
picture
;
but
consider
COMMA
if
you
can
bear
it
COMMA
what
might
have
happened
if
MacArthur
COMMA
for
some
perverse
COMMA
undaunted
reason
COMMA
had
made
the
same
remark
to
an
Eskimo
girl
in
Eskimo
.

To
her
peanuts
and
emeralds
would
have
been
just
so
much
blubber
.

The
point
--
quite
simply
--
is
this
:
words
they
might
have
had
;
but
communication
COMMA
no
.

This
basic
principle
COMMA
the
first
in
a
richly
knotted
bundle
COMMA
was
conveyed
to
me
by
Dr.
Henry
Lee
Smith
COMMA
Jr.
COMMA
at
the
University
of
Buffalo
COMMA
where
he
heads
the
world
's
first
department
of
anthropology
and
linguistics
.

A
brisk
COMMA
amusing
man
COMMA
apparently
constructed
on
an
ingenious
system
of
spring
-
joints
attuned
to
the
same
peppery
rhythm
as
his
mind
COMMA
Smith
began
his
academic
career
teaching
speech
to
Barnard
girls
--
a
project
considerably
enlivened
by
his
devotion
to
a
recording
about
``
a
young
rat
named
Arthur
COMMA
who
never
could
make
up
his
mind
''
.

Later
COMMA
he
became
one
of
the
central
spirits
of
the
Army
Language
Program
and
the
language
school
of
Washington
's
Foreign
Service
Institute
.

It
was
there
COMMA
in
the
course
of
trying
to
prepare
new
men
for
the
``
culture
shock
''
they
might
encounter
in
remote
overseas
posts
COMMA
that
he
first
began
to
develop
a
system
of
charting
the
``
norms
of
human
communication
''
.

To
the
trained
ear
of
the
linguist
COMMA
talk
has
always
revealed
a
staggering
quantity
of
information
about
the
talker
--
such
things
as
geographical
origin
and
history
COMMA
socio-economic
identity
COMMA
education
.

It
is
only
fairly
recently
COMMA
however
COMMA
that
linguists
have
developed
a
systematic
way
of
charting
voices
on
paper
in
a
way
that
tells
even
more
about
the
speakers
and
about
the
success
or
failure
of
human
communication
between
two
people
.

This
COMMA
for
obvious
reasons
COMMA
makes
their
techniques
superbly
useful
in
studying
the
psychiatric
interview
COMMA
so
useful
COMMA
in
fact
COMMA
that
they
have
been
successfully
used
to
suggest
ways
to
speed
diagnosis
and
to
evaluate
the
progress
of
therapy
.

In
the
early
1950's
COMMA
Smith
COMMA
together
with
his
distinguished
colleague
COMMA
George
Trager
(
so
austerely
academic
he
sometimes
fights
his
own
evident
charm
)
COMMA
and
a
third
man
with
the
engaging
name
of
Birdwhistell
(
Ray
)
COMMA
agreed
on
some
basic
premises
about
the
three
-
part
process
that
makes
communication
:
(
1
)
words
or
language
(
2
)
paralanguage
COMMA
a
set
of
phenomena
including
laughing
COMMA
weeping
COMMA
voice
breaks
COMMA
and
``
tone
''
of
voice
COMMA
and
(
3
)
kinesics
COMMA
the
technical
name
for
gestures
COMMA
facial
expressions
COMMA
and
body
shifts
--
nodding
or
shaking
the
head
COMMA
``
talking
''
with
one
's
hands
COMMA
et
cetera
.

Smith
's
first
workout
with
stresses
COMMA
pitches
COMMA
and
junctures
was
based
on
mother
COMMA
which
spells
COMMA
in
our
culture
COMMA
a
good
deal
more
than
bread
alone
.

For
example
COMMA
if
you
are
a
reasonably
well
-
adjusted
person
COMMA
there
are
certain
ways
that
are
reasonable
and
appropriate
for
addressing
your
mother
.

The
usual
U.S.
norm
would
be
:
A[fj]
Middle
pitches
COMMA
slight
pause
(
juncture
)
before
mother
COMMA
slight
rise
at
the
end
.

The
symbols
of
mother
's
status
COMMA
here
COMMA
are
all
usual
for
culture
U.S.A.
.

Quite
other
feelings
are
evidenced
by
this
style
:
A[fj]
Note
the
drop
to
pitch
1
(
the
lowest
)
on
mother
with
no
rise
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
;
this
is
a
``
fade
''
ending
COMMA
and
what
you
have
here
is
a
downtalking
style
of
speech
COMMA
expressing
something
less
than
conventional
respect
for
mother
.

Even
less
regard
for
mom
and
mom
's
apple
pie
goes
with
:
A[fj]

In
other
words
COMMA
the
way
the
speaker
relates
to
mother
is
clearly
indicated
.

And
while
the
meaning
of
the
words
is
not
in
this
instance
altered
COMMA
the
quality
of
communication
in
both
the
second
and
third
examples
is
definitely
impaired
.

An
accompanying
record
of
paralanguage
factors
for
the
second
example
might
also
note
a
throaty
rasp
.

With
this
seven
-
word
sentence
--
though
the
speaker
undoubtedly
thought
he
was
dealing
only
with
the
subject
of
food
--
he
was
telling
things
about
himself
and
COMMA
in
the
last
two
examples
COMMA
revealing
that
he
had
departed
from
the
customs
of
his
culture
.

The
joint
investigations
of
linguistics
and
psychiatry
have
established
COMMA
in
point
of
fact
COMMA
that
no
matter
what
the
subject
of
conversation
is
or
what
words
are
involved
COMMA
it
is
impossible
for
people
to
talk
at
all
without
telling
over
and
over
again
what
sort
of
people
they
are
and
how
they
relate
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.

Since
interviewing
is
the
basic
therapeutic
and
diagnostic
instrument
of
modern
psychiatry
COMMA
the
recording
of
interviews
for
playbacks
and
study
has
been
a
boost
of
Redstone
proportions
in
new
research
and
training
.

Some
of
the
earliest
recordings
COMMA
made
in
the
1940's
demonstrated
that
psychiatrists
reacted
immediately
to
anger
and
anxiety
in
the
sound
track
COMMA
whereas
written
records
of
the
same
interview
offered
far
fewer
cues
to
therapy
which
--
if
they
were
at
all
discernible
in
print
--
were
picked
up
only
by
the
most
skilled
and
sensitive
experts
.

In
a
general
way
COMMA
psychiatrists
were
able
to
establish
on
a
wide
basis
what
many
of
them
had
always
felt
--
that
the
most
telling
cues
in
psychotherapy
are
acoustic
COMMA
that
such
things
as
stress
and
nagging
are
transmitted
by
sound
alone
and
not
necessarily
by
words
.

At
a
minimum
COMMA
recording
--
usually
on
tape
COMMA
which
is
now
in
wide
professional
use
--
brings
the
psychiatric
interview
alive
so
that
the
full
range
of
emotion
and
meaning
can
be
explored
repeatedly
by
the
therapist
or
by
a
battery
of
therapists
.

Newest
to
this
high
-
powered
battery
are
the
experts
in
linguistics
who
have
carried
that
minimum
to
a
new
level
.

By
adding
a
systematic
analysis
with
symbols
to
the
typed
transcripts
of
interviews
COMMA
they
have
supplied
a
new
set
of
techniques
for
the
therapist
.

Linguistic
charting
of
the
transcribed
interview
flags
points
where
the
patient
's
voice
departs
from
expected
norms
.

It
flags
such
possible
breakdowns
of
communication
as
rehearsed
dialogue
COMMA
the
note
of
disapproval
COMMA
ambivalence
or
ambiguity
COMMA
annoyance
COMMA
resentment
COMMA
and
the
disinclination
to
speak
at
all
--
this
last
often
marked
by
a
fade-in
beginning
of
sentences
.

Interpretation
COMMA
naturally
COMMA
remains
the
role
of
the
therapist
COMMA
but
orientation
--
not
only
the
patient
's
vocal
giveaways
of
geographical
and
socio-economic
background
COMMA
but
also
vocal
but
non-verbal
giveaways
of
danger
spots
in
his
relationship
to
people
--
can
be
considerably
beefed
up
by
the
linguist
.

His
esoteric
chartings
of
the
voice
alert
the
therapist
to
areas
where
deeper
probing
may
bring
to
light
underlying
psychological
difficulties
COMMA
making
them
apparent
first
to
the
therapist
and
eventually
to
the
patient
.

In
one
now
-
historic
first
interview
COMMA
for
example
COMMA
the
transcript
(
reproduced
from
the
book
COMMA
The
First
Five
Minutes
)
goes
like
this
:
The
therapist
's
level
tone
is
bland
and
neutral
--
he
has
COMMA
for
example
COMMA
avoided
stressing
``
you
''
COMMA
which
would
imply
disapproval
;
or
surprise
COMMA
which
would
set
the
patient
apart
from
other
people
.

The
patient
COMMA
on
the
other
hand
COMMA
is
far
from
neutral
;
aside
from
her
specifically
regional
accent
COMMA
she
reveals
by
the
use
of
the
triad
COMMA
``
irritable
COMMA
tense
COMMA
depressed
''
COMMA
a
certain
pedantic
itemization
that
indicates
she
has
some
familiarity
with
literary
or
scientific
language
(
i.e.
COMMA
she
must
have
had
at
least
a
high-school
education
)
COMMA
and
she
is
telling
a
story
she
has
mentally
rehearsed
some
time
before
.

Then
she
catapults
into
``
everything
and
everybody
''
COMMA
putting
particular
violence
on
``
everybody
''
COMMA
indicating
to
the
linguist
that
this
is
a
spot
to
flag
--
that
is
COMMA
it
is
not
congruent
to
the
patient
's
general
style
of
speech
up
to
this
point
.

Consequently
COMMA
it
is
referred
to
the
therapist
for
attention
.

He
may
then
very
well
conclude
that
``
everybody
''
is
probably
not
the
true
target
of
her
resentment
.

Immediately
thereafter
COMMA
the
patient
fractures
her
rehearsed
story
COMMA
veering
into
an
oversoft
COMMA
breathy
COMMA
sloppily
articulated
COMMA
``
I
do
n't
feel
like
talking
right
now
''
.

Within
the
first
five
minutes
of
this
interview
it
is
apparent
to
the
therapist
that
``
everybody
''
truthfully
refers
to
the
woman
's
husband
.

She
says
later
COMMA
but
still
within
the
opening
five
minutes
COMMA
``
I
keep
thinking
of
a
divorce
but
that
's
another
emotional
death
''
.

The
linguistic
and
paralinguistic
signals
of
misery
are
all
present
in
the
voice
chart
for
this
sentence
;
so
are
certain
signals
that
she
does
not
accept
divorce
.

By
saying
``
another
emotional
death
''
COMMA
she
reveals
that
there
has
been
a
previous
one
COMMA
although
she
has
not
described
it
in
words
.

This
the
therapist
may
pursue
in
later
questioning
.

The
phrase
COMMA
``
emotional
death
''
COMMA
interesting
and
COMMA
to
a
non-scientific
mind
COMMA
rather
touching
COMMA
suggests
that
this
woman
may
have
some
flair
for
words
COMMA
perhaps
even
something
of
the
temperament
regrettably
called
``
creative
''
.

Since
the
psychiatric
interview
COMMA
like
any
other
interview
COMMA
depends
on
communication
COMMA
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
therapist
in
this
interview
was
a
man
of
marked
skill
and
long
experience
.

His
own
communication
apparatus
operated
superbly
COMMA
and
Lillian
Ross
readers
will
note
instantly
its
total
lack
of
resemblance
to
the
blunted
COMMA
monumentally
unmeshed
mechanism
of
Dr.
Blauberman
.

Interestingly
enough
--
although
none
of
the
real-life
therapists
involved
could
conceivably
compare
with
Blauberman
--
when
groups
of
them
began
playing
back
interviews
COMMA
they
discovered
any
number
of
ways
in
which
they
wanted
to
polish
their
own
interview
techniques
;
almost
everyone
COMMA
on
first
hearing
one
of
his
own
sessions
on
tape
COMMA
expressed
some
desire
to
take
the
whole
thing
over
again
.

Yet
COMMA
in
spite
of
this
COMMA
intensive
study
of
the
taped
interviews
by
teams
of
psychotherapists
and
linguists
laid
bare
the
surprising
fact
that
COMMA
in
the
first
five
minutes
of
an
initial
interview
COMMA
the
patient
often
reveals
as
many
as
a
dozen
times
just
what
's
wrong
with
him
;
to
spot
these
giveaways
the
therapist
must
know
either
intuitively
or
scientifically
how
to
listen
.

Naturally
COMMA
the
patient
does
not
say
COMMA
``
I
hate
my

''
COMMA
or
``
Sibling
rivalry
is
what
bugs
me
''
.

What
he
does
do
is
give
himself
away
by
communicating
information
over
and
above
the
words
involved
.

Some
of
the
classic
indicators
COMMA
as
described
by
Drs.
Pittenger
COMMA
Hockett
COMMA
and
Danehy
in
The
First
Five
Minutes
COMMA
are
these
:
ambiguity
of
pronouns
:
Stammering
or
repetition
of
I
COMMA
you
COMMA
he
COMMA
she
COMMA
et
cetera
may
signal
ambiguity
or
uncertainty
.

On
the
other
hand
significant
facts
may
be
concealed
--
she
may
mean
I
or
everybody
COMMA
as
it
did
with
the
tense
and
irritable
woman
mentioned
before
COMMA
may
refer
to
a
specific
person
.

The
word
that
is
not
used
can
be
as
important
as
the
word
that
is
used
;
therapist
and
linguist
must
always
consider
the
alternatives
.

When
someone
says
COMMA
for
example
COMMA
``
They
took
x-rays
to
see
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
me
''
COMMA
it
pays
to
consider
how
this
statement
would
normally
be
made
.

(
This
patient
COMMA
in
actuality
COMMA
was
a
neurasthenic
who
had
almost
come
to
the
point
of
accepting
the
fact
that
it
was
not
her
soma
but
her
psyche
that
was
the
cause
of
her
difficulty
.
)

Amateur
linguists
note
here
that
Pursewarden
COMMA
in
Durrell
's
Alexandria
Quartet
COMMA
stammered
when
he
spoke
of
his
wife
COMMA
which
is
hardly
surprising
in
view
of
their
disastrous
relationship
.

Northern
liberals
are
the
chief
supporters
of
civil
rights
and
of
integration
.

They
have
also
led
the
nation
in
the
direction
of
a
welfare
state
.

And
both
in
their
objectives
of
non-discrimination
and
of
social
progress
they
have
had
ranged
against
them
the
Southerners
who
are
called
Bourbons
.

The
name
presumably
derives
from
the
French
royal
house
which
never
learned
and
never
forgot
;
since
Bourbon
whiskey
COMMA
though
of
Kentucky
origin
COMMA
is
at
least
as
much
favored
by
liberals
in
the
North
as
by
conservatives
in
the
South
.

The
nature
of
the
opposition
between
liberals
and
Bourbons
is
too
little
understood
in
the
North
.

The
race
problem
has
tended
to
obscure
other
COMMA
less
emotional
COMMA
issues
which
may
fundamentally
be
even
more
divisive
.

It
is
these
other
differences
between
North
and
South
--
other
COMMA
that
is
COMMA
than
those
which
concern
discrimination
or
social
welfare
--
which
I
chiefly
discuss
herein
.

I
write
about
Northern
liberals
from
considerable
personal
experience
.

A
Southerner
married
to
a
New
Englander
COMMA
I
have
lived
for
many
years
in
a
Connecticut
commuting
town
with
a
high
percentage
of
artists
COMMA
writers
COMMA
publicity
men
COMMA
and
business
executives
of
egghead
tastes
.

Most
of
them
are
Democrats
and
nearly
all
consider
themselves
COMMA
and
are
viewed
as
COMMA
liberals
.

This
is
puzzling
to
an
outsider
conscious
of
the
classic
tradition
of
liberalism
COMMA
because
it
is
clear
that
these
Democrats
who
are
left
-
of
-
center
are
at
opposite
poles
from
the
liberal
Jefferson
COMMA
who
held
that
the
best
government
was
the
least
government
.

Yet
paradoxically
my
liberal
friends
continue
to
view
Jefferson
as
one
of
their
patron
saints
.

When
I
question
them
as
to
what
they
mean
by
concepts
like
liberty
and
democracy
COMMA
I
find
that
they
fall
into
two
categories
:
the
simpler
ones
who
have
simply
accepted
the
shibboleths
of
their
faith
without
analysis
;
and
the
intelligent
COMMA
cynical
ones
who
scornfully
reply
that
these
things
do
n't
count
any
more
in
the
world
of
to-day
.

I
am
naive
COMMA
they
say
COMMA
to
make
use
of
such
words
.

I
take
this
to
mean
that
the
intelligent
--
and
therefore
necessarily
cynical
?
--
liberal
considers
that
the
need
for
a
national
economy
with
controls
that
will
assure
his
conception
of
social
justice
is
so
great
that
individual
and
local
liberties
as
well
as
democratic
processes
may
have
to
yield
before
it
.

This
seems
like
an
attitude
favoring
a
sort
of
totalitarian
bureaucracy
which
COMMA
under
a
President
of
the
same
stamp
COMMA
would
try
to
coerce
an
uncooperative
Congress
or
Supreme
Court
.

As
for
states
'
rights
COMMA
they
have
never
counted
in
the
thinking
of
my
liberal
friends
except
as
irritations
of
a
minor
and
immoral
nature
which
exist
now
only
as
anachronisms
.

The
American
liberal
may
COMMA
in
the
world
of
to-day
COMMA
have
a
strong
case
;
but
he
presents
it
publicly
so
enmeshed
in
hypocrisy
that
it
is
not
an
honest
one
.

Why
COMMA
in
the
first
place
COMMA
call
himself
a
liberal
if
he
is
against
laissez-faire
and
favors
an
authoritarian
central
government
with
womb
-
to
-
tomb
controls
over
everybody
?

If
he
attaches
little
importance
to
personal
liberty
COMMA
why
not
make
this
known
to
the
world
?

And
if
he
is
so
scornful
of
the
rights
of
states
COMMA
why
not
advocate
a
different
sort
of
constitution
that
he
could
more
sincerely
support
?

I
am
concerned
here
COMMA
however
COMMA
with
the
Northern
liberal
's
attitude
toward
the
South
.

It
appears
to
be
one
of
intense
dislike
COMMA
which
he
makes
little
effort
to
conceal
even
in
the
presence
of
Southern
friends
.

His
assumption
seems
to
be
that
any
such
friends
COMMA
being
tolerable
humans
COMMA
must
be
more
liberal
than
most
Southerners
and
therefore
at
least
partly
in
sympathy
with
his
views
.

Time
's
editor
COMMA
Thomas
Griffith
COMMA
in
his
book
COMMA
The
Waist
-
High
Culture
COMMA
wrote
:
``
most
of
what
was
different
about
it
(
the
Deep
South
)
I
found
myself
unsympathetic
to
.
''

This
COMMA
for
the
liberals
I
know
COMMA
would
be
an
understatement
.

Theirs
is
no
mere
lack
of
sympathy
COMMA
but
something
closer
to
the
passionate
hatred
that
was
directed
against
Fascism
.

I
do
not
think
that
my
experience
would
be
typical
for
Southerners
living
in
the
North
.

In
business
circles
COMMA
usually
conservative
COMMA
this
sort
of
atmosphere
would
hardly
be
found
.

But
in
our
case
--
and
neither
my
wife
nor
I
have
extreme
views
on
integration
COMMA
nor
are
we
given
to
emotional
outbursts
--
the
situation
has
ruined
one
or
two
valued
friendships
and
come
close
to
wrecking
several
more
.

In
fact
it
has
caused
us
to
give
serious
thought
to
moving
our
residence
south
COMMA
because
it
is
not
easy
for
the
most
objective
Southerner
to
sit
calmly
by
when
his
host
is
telling
a
roomful
of
people
that
the
only
way
to
deal
with
Southerners
who
oppose
integration
is
to
send
in
troops
and
shoot
the
bastards
down
.

Accounts
have
been
published
of
Northern
liberals
in
the
South
up
against
segregationist
prejudice
COMMA
especially
in
state
-
supported
universities
where
pressure
may
be
strong
to
uphold
the
majority
view
.

But
these
accounts
do
not
show
that
Northerners
have
been
subjected
to
embarrassment
or
provocation
by
Yankee
-
hatred
displayed
in
social
gatherings
.

From
my
wife
's
experience
and
other
sources
COMMA
this
seems
to
be
rarely
encountered
in
educated
circles
.

The
strong
feeling
is
certainly
there
;
but
there
is
a
leavening
of
liberalism
among
college
graduates
throughout
the
South
COMMA
especially
among
those
who
studied
in
the
North
.

And
social
relations
arising
out
of
business
ties
impose
courtesy
COMMA
if
not
sympathy
COMMA
toward
resident
and
visiting
Northerners
.

Also
COMMA
among
the
latter
a
large
percentage
soon
acquire
the
prevalent
Southern
attitude
on
most
social
problems
.

There
are
of
course
many
Souths
;
but
for
this
discussion
the
most
important
division
is
between
those
who
have
been
reconstructed
and
those
who
have
n't
.

My
definition
of
this
much
abused
adjective
is
that
a
reconstructed
rebel
is
one
who
is
glad
that
the
North
won
the
War
.

Nobody
knows
how
many
Southerners
there
are
in
this
category
.

I
suspect
that
there
are
far
more
unreconstructed
ones
than
the
North
likes
to
believe
.

I
never
heard
of
a
poll
being
taken
on
the
question
.

No
doubt
such
a
thing
would
be
considered
unpatriotic
.

Prior
to
1954
I
imagine
that
a
majority
of
Southerners
would
have
voted
against
the
Confederacy
.

Since
the
Supreme
Court
's
decision
of
that
year
this
is
more
doubtful
;
and
if
a
poll
had
been
taken
immediately
following
the
dispatch
of
troops
to
Little
Rock
I
believe
the
majority
would
have
been
for
the
Old
South
.

Belief
in
the
traditional
way
of
life
persists
much
more
in
the
older
states
than
in
the
new
ones
.

Probably
a
larger
percentage
of
Virginians
and
South
Carolinians
remain
unreconstructed
than
elsewhere
COMMA
with
Georgia
COMMA
North
Carolina
COMMA
and
Alabama
following
along
after
them
.

Old
attitudes
are
held
more
tenaciously
in
the
Tidewater
than
the
Piedmont
;
so
that
a
line
running
down
the
length
of
the
South
marking
the
upper
limits
of
tidewater
would
roughly
divide
the
Old
South
from
the
new
COMMA
but
with
COMMA
of
course
COMMA
important
minority
enclaves
.

The
long
-
settled
areas
of
states
like
Virginia
and
South
Carolina
developed
the
ante-bellum
culture
to
its
richest
flowering
COMMA
and
there
the
memory
is
more
precious
COMMA
and
the
consciousness
of
loss
the
greater
.

Also
COMMA
we
should
not
even
to-day
discount
the
fact
that
a
region
such
as
the
coastal
lowlands
centering
on
Charleston
had
closer
ties
with
England
and
the
West
Indies
than
with
the
North
even
after
independence
.

The
social
and
psychological
consequences
of
this
continue
to
affect
the
area
.

In
certain
respects
defeat
increased
the
persistent
Anglophilia
of
the
Old
South
.

Poor
where
they
had
once
been
rich
COMMA
humbled
where
they
had
been
arrogant
COMMA
having
no
longer
any
hope
of
sharing
in
the
leadership
of
the
nation
COMMA
the
rebels
who
would
not
surrender
in
spirit
drew
comfort
from
the
sympathy
they
felt
extended
to
them
by
the
mother
country
.

And
no
doubt
many
people
in
states
like
the
Carolinas
and
Georgia
COMMA
which
were
among
the
most
Tory
in
sentiment
in
the
eighteenth
century
COMMA
bitterly
regretted
the
revolt
against
the
Crown
.

Among
Bourbons
the
racial
issue
may
have
less
to
do
with
their
remaining
unreconstructed
than
other
factors
.

All
Southerners
agree
that
slavery
had
to
go
;
but
many
historians
maintain
that
except
for
Northern
meddling
it
would
have
ended
in
states
like
Virginia
years
before
it
did
.

Southern
resentment
has
been
over
the
method
of
its
ending
COMMA
the
invasion
COMMA
and
Reconstruction
;
their
fears
now
are
of
miscegenation
and
Negro
political
control
in
many
counties
.

But
apart
from
racial
problems
COMMA
the
old
unreconstructed
South
--
to
use
the
moderate
words
favored
by
Mr.
Thomas
Griffith
--
finds
itself
unsympathetic
to
most
of
what
is
different
about
the
civilization
of
the
North
.

And
this
COMMA
in
effect
COMMA
means
most
of
modern
America
.

It
is
hard
to
see
how
the
situation
could
be
otherwise
.

And
therein
COMMA
I
feel
COMMA
many
Northerners
delude
themselves
about
the
South
.

For
one
thing
COMMA
this
is
not
a
subject
often
discussed
or
analyzed
.

There
seems
to
be
almost
a
conspiracy
of
silence
veiling
it
.

I
suppose
the
reason
is
a
kind
of
wishful
thinking
:
do
n't
talk
about
the
final
stages
of
Reconstruction
and
they
will
take
care
of
themselves
.

Or
else
the
North
really
believes
that
all
Southerners
except
a
few
quaint
old
characters
have
come
around
to
realizing
the
errors
of
their
past
COMMA
and
are
now
at
heart
sharers
of
the
American
Dream
COMMA
like
everybody
else
.

If
the
circumstances
are
faced
frankly
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
this
to
be
true
.

The
situation
of
the
South
since
1865
has
been
unique
in
the
western
world
.

Regardless
of
rights
and
wrongs
COMMA
a
population
and
an
area
appropriate
to
a
pre
-
World
-
War
-
1
great
power
have
been
COMMA
following
conquest
COMMA
ruled
against
their
will
by
a
neighboring
people
COMMA
and
have
had
imposed
upon
them
social
and
economic
controls
they
dislike
.

And
the
great
majority
of
these
people
are
of
Anglo-Saxon
or
Celtic
descent
.

This
is
the
only
case
in
modern
history
of
a
people
of
Britannic
origin
submitting
without
continued
struggle
to
what
they
view
as
foreign
domination
.

The
fact
is
due
mainly
to
international
wars
COMMA
both
hot
and
cold
.

In
every
war
of
the
United
States
since
the
Civil
War
the
South
was
more
belligerent
than
the
rest
of
the
country
.

So
instead
of
being
tests
of
the
South
's
loyalty
COMMA
the
Spanish
War
COMMA
the
two
World
Wars
COMMA
and
the
Korean
War
all
served
to
overcome
old
grievances
and
cement
reunion
.

And
there
is
no
section
of
the
nation
more
ardent
than
the
South
in
the
cold
war
against
Communism
.

Had
the
situation
been
reversed
COMMA
had
COMMA
for
instance
COMMA
England
been
the
enemy
in
1898
because
of
issues
of
concern
chiefly
to
New
England
COMMA
there
is
little
doubt
that
large
numbers
of
Southerners
would
have
happily
put
on
their
old
Confederate
uniforms
to
fight
as
allies
of
Britain
.

It
is
extraordinary
that
a
people
as
proud
and
warlike
as
Southerners
should
have
been
as
docile
as
they
have
.

The
North
should
thank
its
stars
that
such
has
been
the
case
;
but
at
the
same
time
it
should
not
draw
false
inferences
therefrom
.

The
two
main
charges
levelled
against
the
Bourbons
by
liberals
is
that
they
are
racists
and
social
reactionaries
.

There
is
much
truth
in
both
these
charges
COMMA
and
not
many
Bourbons
deny
them
.

Whatever
their
faults
COMMA
they
are
not
hypocrites
.

Most
of
them
sincerely
believe
that
the
Anglo-Saxon
is
the
best
race
in
the
world
and
that
it
should
remain
pure
.

Many
Northeners
believe
this
COMMA
too
COMMA
but
few
of
them
will
say
so
publicly
.

The
Bourbon
economic
philosophy
COMMA
moreover
COMMA
is
not
very
different
from
that
of
Northern
conservatives
.

But
those
among
the
Bourbons
who
remain
unreconstructed
go
much
further
than
this
.

They
believe
that
if
the
South
had
been
let
alone
it
would
have
produced
a
civilization
superior
to
that
of
modern
America
.

As
it
is
COMMA
they
consider
that
the
North
is
now
reaping
the
fruits
of
excess
egalitarianism
COMMA
that
in
spite
of
its
high
standard
of
living
the
``
American
way
''
has
been
proved
inferior
to
the
English
and
Scandinavian
ways
COMMA
although
they
disapprove
of
the
socialistic
features
of
the
latter
.

The
South
's
antipathy
to
Northern
civilization
includes
such
charges
as
poor
manners
COMMA
harsh
accents
COMMA
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
arts
of
living
like
gastronomy
and
the
use
of
leisure
.

Their
own
easier
COMMA
slower
tempo
is
especially
dear
to
Southerners
;
and
I
have
heard
many
say
that
they
are
content
to
earn
a
half
or
a
third
as
much
as
they
could
up
North
because
they
so
much
prefer
the
quieter
habits
of
their
home
town
.

In
the
past
COMMA
the
duties
of
the
state
COMMA
as
Sir
Henry
Maine
noted
long
ago
COMMA
were
only
two
in
number
:
internal
order
and
external
security
.

By
prevailing
over
other
claimants
for
the
loyalties
of
men
COMMA
the
nation
-
state
maintained
an
adequate
measure
of
certainty
and
order
within
its
territorial
borders
.

Outside
those
limits
it
asserted
COMMA
as
against
other
states
COMMA
a
position
of
sovereign
equality
COMMA
and
COMMA
as
against
the
``
inferior
''
peoples
of
the
non-Western
world
COMMA
a
position
of
dominance
.

It
became
the
sole
``
subject
''
of
``
international
law
''
(
a
term
which
COMMA
it
is
pertinent
to
remember
COMMA
was
coined
by
Bentham
)
COMMA
a
body
of
legal
principle
which
by
and
large
was
made
up
of
what
Western
nations
could
do
in
the
world
arena
.

(
That
corpus
of
law
was
a
reflection
of
the
power
system
in
existence
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
.

Speaking
generally
COMMA
it
furthered
--
and
still
tends
to
further
--
the
interests
of
the
Western
powers
.

The
enormous
changes
in
world
politics
have
COMMA
however
COMMA
thrown
it
into
confusion
COMMA
so
much
so
that
it
is
safe
to
say
that
all
international
law
is
now
in
need
of
reexamination
and
clarification
in
light
of
the
social
conditions
of
the
present
era
.
)

Beyond
the
two
basic
tasks
mentioned
above
COMMA
no
attention
was
paid
by
statesman
or
scholar
to
an
idea
of
state
responsibility
COMMA
either
internally
or
externally
.

This
was
particularly
true
in
the
world
arena
COMMA
which
was
an
anarchical
battleground
characterized
by
strife
and
avaricious
competition
for
colonial
empires
.

That
any
sort
of
duty
was
owed
by
his
nation
to
other
nations
would
have
astonished
a
nineteenth-century
statesman
.

His
duty
was
to
his
sovereign
and
to
his
nation
COMMA
and
an
extension
to
peoples
beyond
the
territorial
boundaries
was
not
to
be
contemplated
.

Thus
COMMA
to
cite
but
one
example
COMMA
the
Pax
Britannica
of
the
nineteenth
century
COMMA
whether
with
the
British
navy
ruling
the
seas
or
with
the
City
of
London
ruling
world
finance
COMMA
was
strictly
national
in
motivation
COMMA
however
much
other
nations
(
e.g.
COMMA
the
United
States
)
may
have
incidentally
benefited
.

At
the
same
time
COMMA
all
suggestions
that
some
sort
of
societal
responsibility
existed
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
within
the
territorial
state
was
strongly
resisted
.

Social
Darwinism
was
able
to
stave
off
the
incipient
socialist
movement
until
well
into
the
present
century
.

However
COMMA
in
recent
decades
COMMA
for
what
doubtless
are
multiple
reasons
COMMA
an
unannounced
but
nonetheless
readily
observable
shift
has
occurred
in
both
facets
of
national
activity
.

A
concept
of
responsibility
is
in
process
of
articulation
and
establishment
.

Already
firmly
implanted
internally
COMMA
it
is
a
growing
factor
in
external
matters
.

A
little
more
than
twenty
years
ago
the
American
people
turned
an
important
corner
.

In
what
has
aptly
been
called
a
``
constitutional
revolution
''
COMMA
the
basic
nature
of
government
was
transformed
from
one
essentially
negative
in
nature
(
the
``
night
-
watchman
state
''
)
to
one
with
affirmative
duties
to
perform
.

The
``
positive
state
''
came
into
existence
.

For
lawyers
COMMA
reflecting
perhaps
their
parochial
preferences
COMMA
there
has
been
a
special
fascination
since
then
in
the
role
played
by
the
Supreme
Court
in
that
transformation
--
the
manner
in
which
its
decisions
altered
in
``
the
switch
in
time
that
saved
nine
''
COMMA
President
Roosevelt
's
ill-starred
but
in
effect
victorious
``
Court
-
packing
plan
''
COMMA
the
imprimatur
of
judicial
approval
that
was
finally
placed
upon
social
legislation
.

Of
greater
importance
COMMA
however
COMMA
is
the
content
of
those
programs
COMMA
which
have
had
and
are
having
enormous
consequences
for
the
American
people
.

Labor
relations
have
been
transformed
COMMA
income
security
has
become
a
standardized
feature
of
political
platforms
COMMA
and
all
the
many
facets
of
the
American
version
of
the
welfare
state
have
become
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
.

A
national
consensus
of
near
unanimity
exists
that
these
governmental
efforts
are
desirable
as
well
as
necessary
.

Ratified
in
the
Republican
Party
victory
in
1952
COMMA
the
Positive
State
is
now
evidenced
by
political
campaigns
being
waged
not
on
whether
but
on
how
much
social
legislation
there
should
be
.

The
general
acceptance
of
the
idea
of
governmental
(
i.e.
COMMA
societal
)
responsibility
for
the
economic
well-being
of
the
American
people
is
surely
one
of
the
two
most
significant
watersheds
in
American
constitutional
history
.

The
other
COMMA
of
course
COMMA
was
the
Civil
War
COMMA
the
conflict
which
a
century
ago
insured
national
unity
over
fragmentation
.

A
third
COMMA
one
of
at
least
equal
and
perhaps
even
greater
importance
COMMA
is
now
being
traversed
:
American
immersion
and
involvement
in
world
affairs
.

Internal
national
responsibility
COMMA
now
a
truism
COMMA
need
not
be
documented
.

Nevertheless
COMMA
it
may
be
helpful
to
cite
one
example
--
that
of
employment
--
for
COMMA
as
will
be
shown
below
COMMA
it
cuts
across
both
facets
of
the
new
concept
.

Thirty
years
ago
COMMA
while
the
nation
was
wallowing
in
economic
depression
COMMA
the
prevailing
philosophy
of
government
was
to
stand
aside
and
allow
``
natural
forces
''
to
operate
and
cure
the
distress
.

That
guiding
principle
of
the
Hoover
Administration
fell
to
the
siege
guns
of
the
New
Deal
;
less
than
a
score
of
years
later
Congress
enacted
the
Employment
Act
of
1946
COMMA
by
which
the
national
government
assumed
the
responsibility
of
taking
action
to
insure
conditions
of
maximum
employment
.

Hands
-
off
the
economy
was
replaced
by
conscious
guidance
through
planning
--
the
economic
side
of
the
constitutional
revolution
.

In
1961
the
first
important
legislative
victory
of
the
Kennedy
Administration
came
when
the
principle
of
national
responsibility
for
local
economic
distress
won
out
over
a
``
state
's
-
responsibility
''
proposal
--
provision
was
made
for
payment
for
unemployment
relief
by
nation
-
wide
taxation
rather
than
by
a
levy
only
on
those
states
afflicted
with
manpower
surplus
.

The
American
people
have
indeed
come
a
long
way
in
the
brief
interval
between
1930
and
1961
.

Internal
national
responsibility
is
a
societal
response
to
the
impact
of
the
Industrial
Revolution
.

Reduced
to
its
simplest
terms
COMMA
it
is
an
assumption
of
a
collective
duty
to
compensate
for
the
inability
of
individuals
to
cope
with
the
rigors
of
the
era
.

National
responsibility
for
individual
welfare
is
a
concept
not
limited
to
the
United
States
or
even
to
the
Western
nations
.

A
measure
of
its
widespread
acceptance
may
be
derived
from
a
statement
of
the
International
Congress
of
Jurists
in
1959
.

Meeting
in
New
Delhi
under
the
auspices
of
the
International
Commission
of
Jurists
COMMA
a
body
of
lawyers
from
the
free
world
COMMA
the
Congress
redefined
and
expanded
the
traditional
Rule
of
Law
to
include
affirmative
governmental
duties
.

It
is
noteworthy
that
the
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
Congress
were
from
the
less
developed
COMMA
former
colonial
nations
.

The
Rule
of
Law
COMMA
historically
a
principle
according
everyone
his
``
day
in
court
''
before
an
impartial
tribunal
COMMA
was
broadened
substantively
by
making
it
a
responsibility
of
government
to
promote
individual
welfare
.

Recognizing
that
the
Rule
of
Law
is
``
a
dynamic
concept
which
should
be
employed
not
only
to
safeguard
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
the
individual
in
a
free
society
''
COMMA
the
Congress
asserted
that
it
also
included
the
responsibility
``
to
establish
social
COMMA
economic
COMMA
educational
and
cultural
conditions
under
which
his
legitimate
aspirations
and
dignity
may
be
realized
''
.

The
idea
of
national
responsibility
thus
has
become
a
common
feature
of
the
nations
of
the
non-Soviet
world
.

For
better
or
for
worse
COMMA
we
all
now
live
in
welfare
states
COMMA
the
organizing
principle
of
which
is
collective
responsibility
for
individual
well-being
.

Whether
a
concept
analogous
to
the
principle
of
internal
responsibility
operates
in
a
nation
's
external
relations
is
less
obvious
and
more
difficult
to
establish
.

The
hypothesis
ventured
here
is
that
it
does
COMMA
and
that
evidence
is
accumulating
validating
that
proposition
.

The
content
is
not
the
same
COMMA
however
:
rather
than
individual
security
COMMA
it
is
the
security
and
continuing
existence
of
an
``
ideological
group
''
--
those
in
the
``
free
world
''
--
that
is
basic
.

External
national
responsibility
involves
a
burgeoning
requirement
that
the
leaders
of
the
Western
nations
so
guide
their
decisions
as
to
further
the
viability
of
other
friendly
nations
.

If
internal
responsibility
suggests
acceptance
of
the
socialist
ideal
of
equality
COMMA
then
external
responsibility
implies
adherence
to
principles
of
ideological
supranationalism
.

Reference
to
two
other
concepts
--
nationalism
and
sovereignty
--
may
help
to
reveal
the
contours
of
the
new
principle
.

In
its
beginnings
the
nation
-
state
had
to
struggle
to
assert
itself
--
internally
COMMA
against
feudal
groups
COMMA
and
externally
COMMA
against
the
power
and
influence
of
such
other
claimants
for
loyalty
as
the
Church
.

The
breakup
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
the
downfall
of
feudalism
led
COMMA
not
more
than
two
centuries
ago
COMMA
to
the
surge
of
nationalism
.

(
Since
the
time
-
span
of
the
nation
-
state
coincides
roughly
with
the
separate
existence
of
the
United
States
as
an
independent
entity
COMMA
it
is
perhaps
natural
for
Americans
to
think
of
the
nation
as
representative
of
the
highest
form
of
order
COMMA
something
permanent
and
unchanging
.
)

The
concept
of
nationalism
is
the
political
principle
that
epitomizes
and
glorifies
the
territorial
state
as
the
characteristic
type
of
socal
structure
.

But
it
is
more
than
that
.

For
it
includes
the
emotional
ties
that
bind
men
to
their
homeland
and
the
complex
motivations
that
hold
a
large
group
of
people
together
as
a
unit
.

Today
COMMA
as
new
nations
rise
from
the
former
colonial
empires
COMMA
nationalism
is
one
of
the
hurricane
forces
loose
in
the
world
.

Almost
febrile
in
intensity
COMMA
the
principle
has
become
worldwide
in
application
--
unfortunately
at
the
very
time
that
nationalist
fervors
can
wreak
greatest
harm
.

Historically
COMMA
however
COMMA
the
concept
is
one
that
has
been
of
marked
benefit
to
the
people
of
the
Western
civilizational
group
.

By
subduing
disparate
lesser
groups
the
nation
has
COMMA
to
some
degree
at
least
COMMA
broadened
the
capacity
for
individual
liberty
.

Within
their
confines
COMMA
moreover
COMMA
technological
and
industrial
growth
has
proceeded
at
an
accelerated
pace
COMMA
thus
increasing
the
cornucopia
from
which
material
wants
can
be
satisfied
.

While
the
pattern
is
uneven
COMMA
some
having
gained
more
than
others
COMMA
nationalism
has
in
fact
served
the
Western
peoples
well
.

(
Whether
historical
nationalism
helped
the
peoples
of
the
remainder
of
the
world
COMMA
and
whether
today
's
nationalism
in
the
former
colonial
areas
has
equally
beneficial
aspects
COMMA
are
other
questions
.
)

It
is
one
of
the
ironic
quirks
of
history
that
the
viability
and
usefulness
of
nationalism
and
the
territorial
state
are
rapidly
dissipating
at
precisely
the
time
that
the
nation
-
state
attained
its
highest
number
(
approximately
100
)
.

But
it
is
more
than
irony
:
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
nationalism
is
no
longer
a
tenable
concept
is
because
it
has
spread
throughout
the
planet
.

In
other
words
COMMA
nationalism
worked
well
enough
when
it
had
limited
application
COMMA
both
as
to
geography
and
as
to
population
;
it
becomes
a
perilous
anachronism
when
adopted
on
a
world
-
wide
basis
.

Complementing
the
political
principle
of
nationalism
is
the
legal
principle
of
sovereignty
.

The
former
receives
its
legitimacy
from
the
latter
.

Operating
side
by
side
COMMA
together
they
helped
shore
up
the
nation
-
state
.

While
sovereignty
has
roots
in
antiquity
COMMA
in
its
present
usage
it
is
essentially
modern
.

Jean
Bodin
COMMA
writing
in
the
sixteenth
century
COMMA
may
have
been
the
seminal
thinker
COMMA
but
it
was
the
vastly
influential
John
Austin
who
set
out
the
main
lines
of
the
concept
as
now
understood
.

Austin
's
nineteenth-century
view
of
law
and
sovereignty
still
dominates
much
of
today
's
legal
and
political
thinking
.

To
him
COMMA
law
is
the
command
of
the
sovereign
(
the
English
monarch
)
who
personifies
the
power
of
the
nation
COMMA
while
sovereignty
is
the
power
to
make
law
--
i.e.
COMMA
to
prevail
over
internal
groups
and
to
be
free
from
the
commands
of
other
sovereigns
in
other
nations
.

These
fundamental
ideas
--
the
indivisibility
of
sovereignty
and
its
dual
(
internal
-
external
)
aspects
--
still
remain
the
core
of
that
concept
of
ultimate
political
power
.

The
nation
-
state
COMMA
then
COMMA
exemplifies
the
principle
of
nationalism
and
exercises
sovereignty
:
supreme
power
over
domestic
affairs
and
independence
from
outside
control
.

In
fact
COMMA
however
COMMA
both
principles
have
always
been
nebulous
and
loosely
defined
.

High-level
abstractions
are
always
difficult
to
pin
down
with
precision
.

That
is
particularly
true
of
sovereignty
when
it
is
applied
to
democratic
societies
COMMA
in
which
``
popular
''
sovereignty
is
said
to
exist
COMMA
and
in
federal
nations
COMMA
in
which
the
jobs
of
government
are
split
.

Nevertheless
COMMA
nationalism
and
sovereignty
are
reputed
COMMA
in
the
accepted
wisdom
COMMA
to
describe
the
modern
world
.

Is
there
a
different
reality
behind
the
facade
?

Does
the
surface
hide
a
quite
different
picture
?

The
short
answer
to
those
questions
is
``
yes
''
.

Both
concepts
are
undergoing
alteration
;
to
some
degree
they
are
being
supplanted
by
a
concept
of
national
responsibility
.

As
evidence
to
support
that
view
COMMA
consider
the
following
illustrative
instances
.

Can
thermonuclear
war
be
set
off
by
accident
?

What
steps
have
been
taken
to
guard
against
the
one
sort
of
mishap
that
could
trigger
the
destruction
of
continents
?

Are
we
as
safe
as
we
should
be
from
such
a
disaster
?

Is
anything
being
done
to
increase
our
margin
of
safety
?

Will
the
danger
increase
or
decrease
?

I
have
just
asked
these
questions
in
the
Pentagon
COMMA
in
the
White
House
COMMA
in
offices
of
key
scientists
across
the
country
and
aboard
the
submarines
that
prowl
for
months
underwater
COMMA
with
neat
rows
of
green
launch
tubes
which
contain
Polaris
missiles
and
which
are
affectionately
known
as
``
Sherwood
Forest
''
.

I
asked
the
same
questions
inside
the
launch
-
control
rooms
of
an
Atlas
missile
base
in
Wyoming
COMMA
where
officers
who
wear
sidearms
are
manning
the
``
commit
buttons
''
that
could
start
a
war
--
accidentally
or
by
design
--
and
in
the
command
centers
where
other
pistol
-
packing
men
could
give
orders
to
push
such
buttons
.

To
the
men
in
the
instrument
-
jammed
bomber
cockpits
COMMA
submarine
compartments
and
the
antiseptic
COMMA
windowless
rooms
that
would
be
the
foxholes
of
tomorrow
's
impersonal
intercontinental
wars
COMMA
the
questions
seem
farfetched
.

There
is
unceasing
pressure
COMMA
but
its
sources
are
immediate
.

``
Readiness
exercises
''
are
almost
continuous
.

Each
could
be
the
real
thing
.

In
the
command
centers
there
are
special
clocks
ready
to
tick
off
the
minutes
elapsed
since
``
E
hour
''
.

``
E
''
stands
for
``
execution
''
--
the
moment
a
``
go
order
''
would
unleash
an
American
nuclear
strike
.

There
is
little
time
for
the
men
in
the
command
centers
to
reflect
about
the
implications
of
these
clocks
.

They
are
preoccupied
riding
herd
on
control
panels
COMMA
switches
COMMA
flashing
colored
lights
on
pale
green
or
gray
consoles
that
look
like
business
machines
.

They
know
little
about
their
machinery
beyond
mechanical
details
.

Accidental
war
is
so
sensitive
a
subject
that
most
of
the
people
who
could
become
directly
involved
in
one
are
told
just
enough
so
they
can
perform
their
portions
of
incredibly
complex
tasks
.

Among
the
policy
makers
COMMA
generals
COMMA
physicists
COMMA
psychologists
and
others
charged
with
controlling
the
actions
of
the
button
pushers
and
their
``

COMMA
the
answers
to
my
questions
varied
partly
according
to
a
man
's
flair
for
what
the
professionals
in
this
field
call
``
scenarios
''
.

As
an
Air
Force
psychiatrist
put
it
:
``
You
ca
n't
have
dry
runs
on
this
one
''
.

The
experts
are
thus
forced
to
hypothesize
sequences
of
events
that
have
never
occurred
COMMA
probably
never
will
--
but
possibly
might
.

Only
one
rule
prevailed
in
my
conversations
with
these
men
:
The
more
highly
placed
they
are
--
that
is
COMMA
the
more
they
know
--
the
more
concerned
they
have
become
.

Already
accidental
war
is
a
silent
guest
at
the
discussions
within
the
Kennedy
Administration
about
the
urgency
of
disarmament
and
nearly
all
other
questions
of
national
security
.

Only
recently
new
``
holes
''
were
discovered
in
our
safety
measures
COMMA
and
a
search
is
now
on
for
more
.

Work
is
under
way
to
see
whether
new
restraining
devices
should
be
installed
on
all
nuclear
weapons
.

Meanwhile
COMMA
the
experts
speak
of
wars
triggered
by
``
false
pre-emption
''
COMMA
``
escalation
''
COMMA
``
unauthorized
behavior
''
and
other
terms
that
will
be
discussed
in
this
report
.

They
inhabit
a
secret
world
centered
on
``
go
codes
''
and
``
gold
phones
''
.

Their
conversations
were
COMMA
almost
invariably
COMMA
accompanied
by
the
same
gestures
--
arms
and
pointed
forefingers
darting
toward
each
other
in
arclike
semicircular
motions
.

One
arm
represented
our
bombers
and
missiles
COMMA
the
other
arm
``
theirs
''
.

Yet
implicit
in
each
movement
was
the
death
of
millions
COMMA
perhaps
hundreds
of
millions
COMMA
perhaps
you
and
me
--
and
the
experts
.

These
men
are
not
callous
.

It
is
their
job
to
think
about
the
unthinkable
.

Unanimously
they
believe
that
the
world
would
become
a
safer
place
if
more
of
us
--
and
more
Russians
and
Communist
Chinese
COMMA
too
--
thought
about
accidental
war
.

The
first
systematic
thinking
about
this
Pandora
's
box
within
Pandora
's
boxes
was
done
four
years
ago
by
Fred
Ikle
COMMA
a
frail
COMMA
meek-mannered
Swiss
-
born
sociologist
.

He
was
COMMA
and
is
COMMA
with
the
RAND
Corporation
COMMA
a
nonprofit
pool
of
thinkers
financed
by
the
U.S.
Air
Force
.

His
investigations
made
him
the
Paul
Revere
of
accidental
war
COMMA
and
safety
procedures
were
enormously
increased
.

In
recent
weeks
COMMA
as
a
result
of
a
sweeping
defense
policy
reappraisal
by
the
Kennedy
Administration
COMMA
basic
United
States
strategy
has
been
modified
--
and
large
new
sums
allocated
--
to
meet
the
accidental-war
danger
and
to
reduce
it
as
quickly
as
possible
.

The
chain
starts
at
BMEWS
(
Ballistic
Missile
Early
Warning
System
)
in
Thule
COMMA
Greenland
.

Its
radar
screens
would
register
Soviet
missiles
shortly
after
they
are
launched
against
the
United
States
.

BMEWS
intelligence
is
simultaneously
flashed
to
NORAD
(
North
American
Air
Defense
Command
)
in
Colorado
Springs
COMMA
Colorado
COMMA
for
interpretation
;
to
the
SAC
command
and
control
post
COMMA
forty-five
feet
below
the
ground
at
Offutt
Air
Force
Base
COMMA
near
Omaha
COMMA
Nebraska
;
to
the
Joint
War
Room
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
in
the
Pentagon
and
to
the
President
.

Telephones
COMMA
Teletypes
COMMA
several
kinds
of
radio
systems
and
COMMA
in
some
cases
COMMA
television
COMMA
link
all
vital
points
.

Alternate
locations
exist
for
all
key
command
centers
.

For
last-ditch
emergencies
SAC
has
alternate
command
posts
on
KC-135
jet
tankers
.

Multiple
circuits
COMMA
routings
and
frequencies
make
the
chain
as
unbreakable
as
possible
.

The
same
principle
of
``
redundancy
''
applies
to
all
communications
on
these
special
networks
.

And
no
messages
can
be
transmitted
on
these
circuits
until
senders
and
receivers
authenticate
in
advance
COMMA
by
special
codes
COMMA
that
the
messages
actually
come
from
their
purported
sources
.

Additional
codes
can
be
used
to
challenge
and
counterchallenge
the
authentications
.

Only
the
President
is
permitted
to
authorize
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
.

That
's
the
law
.

But
what
if
somebody
decides
to
break
it
?

The
President
can
not
personally
remove
the
safety
devices
from
every
nuclear
trigger
.

He
makes
the
momentous
decision
.

Hundreds
of
men
are
required
to
pass
the
word
to
the
button
pushers
and
to
push
the
buttons
.

What
if
one
or
more
of
them
turn
irrational
or
suddenly
COMMA
coolly
COMMA
decide
to
clobber
the
Russians
?

What
if
the
President
himself
COMMA
in
the
language
of
the
military
COMMA
``
goes
ape
''
?
Or
singlehandedly
decided
to
reverse
national
policy
and
hit
the
Soviets
without
provocation
?

Nobody
can
be
absolutely
certain
of
the
answers
.

However
COMMA
the
system
is
designed
COMMA
ingeniously
and
hopefully
COMMA
so
that
no
one
man
could
initiate
a
thermonuclear
war
.

Even
the
President
can
not
pick
up
his
telephone
and
give
a
``
go
''
order
.

Even
he
does
not
know
the
one
signal
for
a
nuclear
strike
--
the
``
go
code
''
.

In
an
emergency
he
would
receive
available
intelligence
on
the
``
gold-phone
circuit
''
.

A
system
of
``
gold
''
--
actually
yellow
--
phones
connects
him
with
the
offices
and
action
stations
of
the
Secretary
of
Defense
COMMA
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
COMMA
the
SAC
commander
and
other
key
men
.

All
can
be
connected
with
the
gold
circuit
from
their
homes
.

All
could
help
the
President
make
his
decision
.

The
talk
would
not
be
in
code
COMMA
but
neither
would
it
ramble
.

Vital
questions
would
be
quickly
answered
according
to
a
preprepared
agenda
.

Officers
who
participate
in
the
continual
practice
drills
assured
me
that
the
President
's
decision
could
be
made
and
announced
on
the
gold
circuit
within
minutes
after
the
first
flash
from
A[fj]
.

If
communications
work
COMMA
his
decision
would
be
instantly
known
in
all
command
posts
that
would
originate
the
actual
go
order
.

For
these
centers
COMMA
too
COMMA
are
on
the
gold
circuit
.

They
include
the
Navy
's
Atlantic
Command
at
Norfolk
COMMA
Virginia
COMMA
which
is
in
contact
with
the
Polaris
subs
;
NATO
headquarters
in
Europe
;
Air
Force
forward
headquarters
in
Europe
and
in
the
Pacific
COMMA
which
control
tactical
fighters
on
ships
and
land
bases
;
and
SAC
COMMA
which
controls
long-range
bombers
and
Atlas
missiles
.

Let
us
look
in
on
one
of
these
nerve
centers
--
SAC
at
Omaha
--
and
see
what
must
still
happen
before
a
wing
of
B-52
bombers
could
drop
their
A[fj]
.

In
a
word
COMMA
plenty
.

The
key
man
almost
certainly
would
be
Col.
William
W.
Wisman
COMMA
SAC
's
senior
controller
.

He
or
his
deputy
or
one
of
their
seven
assistants
COMMA
all
full
colonels
COMMA
mans
the
heart
of
the
command
post
twenty-four
hours
a
day
.

It
is
a
quiet
but
impressive
room
--
140
feet
long
COMMA
thirty-nine
feet
wide
COMMA
twenty-one
feet
high
.

Movable
panels
of
floor
-
to
-
ceiling
maps
and
charts
are
crammed
with
intelligence
information
.

And
Bill
Wisman
COMMA
forty-three
COMMA
a
farmer
's
son
from
Beallsville
COMMA
Ohio
COMMA
is
a
quiet
but
impressive
man
.

His
eyes
are
steady
anchors
of
the
deepest
brown
.

His
movements
and
speech
are
precise
COMMA
clear
and
quick
.

No
question
ruffles
him
or
causes
him
to
hesitate
.

Wisman
COMMA
who
has
had
the
chief
controller
's
job
for
four
years
COMMA
calls
the
signals
for
a
team
operating
three
rows
of
dull-gray
consoles
studded
with
lights
COMMA
switches
and
buttons
.

At
least
a
dozen
men
COMMA
some
armed
COMMA
are
never
far
away
from
him
.

In
front
of
him
is
a
gold
phone
.

In
emergencies
the
SAC
commander
COMMA
Gen.
Thomas
Power
COMMA
or
his
deputies
and
their
staff
would
occupy
a
balcony
that
stretches
across
the
length
of
the
room
above
Wisman
and
his
staff
.

At
General
Power
's
seat
in
the
balcony
there
is
also
a
gold
phone
.

General
Power
would
participate
in
the
decision
making
.

Wisman
COMMA
below
COMMA
would
listen
in
and
act
.

His
consoles
can
give
him
instant
contact
with
more
than
seventy
bases
around
the
world
and
with
every
SAC
aircraft
.

He
need
only
pick
up
one
of
the
two
red
telephone
receivers
at
his
extreme
left
COMMA
right
next
to
the
big
red
button
marked
alert
.

(
There
are
two
receivers
in
case
one
should
be
dropped
and
damaged
.
)

But
Wisman
COMMA
too
COMMA
does
not
know
the
go
code
.

He
must
take
it
from
``
the
red
box
''
.

In
point
of
fact
COMMA
this
is
a
beige
box
with
a
bright
red
door
COMMA
about
one
and
a
half
feet
square
and
hung
from
the
wall
about
six
feet
from
the
door
to
Wisman
's
right
.

The
box
is
internally
wired
so
the
door
can
never
be
opened
without
setting
off
a
screeching
klaxon
(
``
It
's
real
obnoxious
''
)
.

Now
we
must
become
vague
COMMA
for
we
are
approaching
one
of
the
nation
's
most
guarded
secrets
.

The
codes
in
the
red
box
--
there
are
several
of
them
covering
various
contingencies
--
are
contained
in
a
sealed
X-ray
-
proof
``
unique
device
''
.

They
are
supplied
COMMA
a
batch
at
a
time
COMMA
by
a
secret
source
and
are
continually
changed
by
Wisman
or
his
staff
COMMA
at
random
intervals
.

But
even
the
contents
of
Wisman
's
box
can
not
start
a
war
.

They
are
mere
fragments
COMMA
just
one
portion
of
preprepared
messages
.

What
these
fragments
are
and
how
they
activate
the
go
order
may
not
be
revealed
.

The
pieces
must
be
placed
in
the
context
of
the
prepared
messages
by
Wisman
's
staff
.

In
addition
to
the
authentication
and
acknowledgment
procedures
which
precede
and
follow
the
sending
of
the
go
messages
COMMA
again
in
special
codes
COMMA
each
message
also
contains
an
``
internal
authenticator
''
COMMA
another
specific
signal
to
convince
the
recipient
that
he
is
getting
the
real
thing
.

I
asked
Wisman
what
would
happen
if
he
broke
out
the
go
codes
and
tried
to
start
transmitting
one
.

``
I
'd
wind
up
full
of
bullet
holes
''
COMMA
he
said
COMMA
and
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
talking
about
bullets
fired
by
his
coworkers
.

Now
let
us
imagine
a
wing
of
B-52
's
COMMA
on
alert
near
their
``
positive
control
(
or
fail
-
safe
)
points
''
COMMA
the
spots
on
the
map
COMMA
many
miles
from
Soviet
territory
COMMA
beyond
which
they
are
forbidden
to
fly
without
specific
orders
to
proceed
to
their
targets
.

They
COMMA
too
COMMA
have
fragments
of
the
go
code
with
them
.

As
Wisman
put
it
COMMA
``
They
have
separate
pieces
of
the
pie
COMMA
and
we
have
the
whole
pie
.

Once
we
send
out
the
whole
pie
COMMA
they
can
put
their
pieces
into
it
.

Unless
we
send
out
the
whole
pie
COMMA
their
pieces
mean
nothing
''
.

Why
does
Wisman
's
ever
-
changing
code
always
mesh
with
the
fragments
in
possession
of
the
button
pushers
?

The
answer
is
a
cryptographic
secret
.

At
any
rate
COMMA
three
men
out
of
a
six
-
man
B-52
crew
are
required
to
copy
down
Wisman
's
go
-
to
-
war
message
.

Each
must
match
Wisman
's
``
pie
''
with
the
fragment
that
he
carries
with
him
.

All
three
must
compare
notes
and
agree
to
``
go
''
.

After
that
COMMA
it
requires
several
minutes
of
concentrated
work
COMMA
including
six
separate
and
deliberate
actions
by
a
minimum
of
three
men
sitting
at
three
separate
stations
in
a
bomber
COMMA
each
with
another
man
beside
him
to
help
COMMA
for
an
armed
bomb
to
be
released
.

Unless
all
gadgets
are
properly
operated
--
and
the
wires
and
seals
from
the
handles
removed
first
--
no
damage
can
be
done
.

WARTIME

After
the
attacks
had
occurred
COMMA
while
crisis
managers
were
still
sorting
out
a
number
of
unnerving
false
alarms
COMMA
Air
Force
One
flew
to
Barksdale
Air
Force
Base
in
Louisiana
.

One
of
these
alarms
was
of
a
reported
threat
against
Air
Force
One
itself
COMMA
a
threat
eventually
run
down
to
a
misunderstood
communication
in
the
hectic
White
House
Situation
Room
that
morning
.

While
the
plan
at
the
elementary
school
had
been
to
return
to
Washington
COMMA
by
the
time
Air
Force
One
was
airborne
at
9:55
A.M.
the
Secret
Service
COMMA
the
President
's
advisers
COMMA
and
Vice
President
Cheney
were
strongly
advising
against
it
.

President
Bush
reluctantly
acceded
to
this
advice
and
COMMA
at
about
10:10
COMMA
Air
Force
One
changed
course
and
began
heading
due
west
.

The
immediate
objective
was
to
find
a
safe
location
-
not
too
far
away
-
where
the
President
could
land
and
speak
to
the
American
people
.

The
Secret
Service
was
also
interested
in
refueling
the
aircraft
and
paring
down
the
size
of
the
traveling
party
.

The
President
's
military
aide
COMMA
an
Air
Force
officer
COMMA
quickly
researched
the
options
and
COMMA
sometime
around
10:20
COMMA
identified
Barksdale
Air
Force
Base
as
an
appropriate
interim
destination
.

When
Air
Force
One
landed
at
Barksdale
at
about
11:45
COMMA
personnel
from
the
local
Secret
Service
office
were
still
en
route
to
the
airfield
.

The
motorcade
consisted
of
a
military
police
lead
vehicle
and
a
van
;

the
proposed
briefing
theater
had
no
phones
or
electrical
outlets
.

Staff
scrambled
to
prepare
another
room
for
the
President
's
remarks
COMMA
while
the
lead
Secret
Service
agent
reviewed
the
security
situation
with
superiors
in
Washington
.

The
President
completed
his
statement
COMMA
which
for
security
reasons
was
taped
and
not
broadcast
live
COMMA
and
the
traveling
party
returned
to
Air
Force
One
.

The
next
destination
was
discussed
:

once
again
the
Secret
Service
recommended
against
returning
to
Washington
COMMA
and
the
Vice
President
agreed
.

Offutt
Air
Force
Base
in
Nebraska
was
chosen
because
of
its
elaborate
command
and
control
facilities
COMMA
and
because
it
could
accommodate
overnight
lodging
for
50
persons
.

The
Secret
Service
wanted
a
place
where
the
President
could
spend
several
days
COMMA
if
necessary
.

Air
Force
One
arrived
at
Offutt
at
2:50
P.M.

At
about
3:15
COMMA
President
Bush
met
with
his
principal
advisers
through
a
secure
video
teleconference
.

Rice
said
President
Bush
began
the
meeting
with
the
words
COMMA
"
We
're
at
war
COMMA
"
and
that
Director
of
Central
Intelligence
George
Tenet
said
the
agency
was
still
assessing
who
was
responsible
COMMA
but
the
early
signs
all
pointed
to
al
Qaeda
.

That
evening
the
Deputies
Committee
returned
to
the
pending
presidential
directive
they
had
labored
over
during
the
summer
.

The
secretary
of
defense
directed
the
nation
's
armed
forces
to
Defense
Condition
3
COMMA
an
increased
state
of
military
readiness
.

For
the
first
time
in
history
COMMA
all
nonemergency
civilian
aircraft
in
the
United
States
were
grounded
COMMA
stranding
tens
of
thousands
of
passengers
across
the
country
.

Contingency
plans
for
the
continuity
of
government
and
the
evacuation
of
leaders
had
been
implemented
.

The
Pentagon
had
been
struck
;

the
White
House
or
the
Capitol
had
narrowly
escaped
direct
attack
.

Extraordinary
security
precautions
were
put
in
place
at
the
nation
's
borders
and
ports
.

In
the
late
afternoon
COMMA
the
President
overruled
his
aides
'
continuing
reluctance
to
have
him
return
to
Washington
and
ordered
Air
Force
One
back
to
Andrews
Air
Force
Base
.

He
was
flown
by
helicopter
back
to
the
White
House
COMMA
passing
over
the
still
-
smoldering
Pentagon
.

At
8:30
that
evening
COMMA
President
Bush
addressed
the
nation
from
the
White
House
.

After
emphasizing
that
the
first
priority
was
to
help
the
injured
and
protect
against
any
further
attacks
COMMA
he
said
:
"
We
will
make
no
distinction
between
the
terrorists
who
committed
these
acts
and
those
who
harbor
them
.
"

He
quoted
Psalm
23
-
"
though
I
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
...
"

No
American
COMMA
he
said
COMMA
"
will
ever
forget
this
day
.
"

Following
his
speech
COMMA
President
Bush
met
again
with
his
National
Security
Council
(
NSC
)
COMMA
expanded
to
include
Secretary
of
Transportation
Norman
Mineta
and
Joseph
Allbaugh
COMMA
the
director
of
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
.

Secretary
of
State
Colin
Powell
COMMA
who
had
returned
from
Peru
after
hearing
of
the
attacks
COMMA
joined
the
discussion
.

They
reviewed
the
day
's
events
.

IMMEDIATE
RESPONSES
AT
HOME

As
the
urgent
domestic
issues
accumulated
COMMA
White
House
Deputy
Chief
of
Staff
Joshua
Bolten
chaired
a
temporary
"
domestic
consequences
"
group
.

The
agenda
in
those
first
days
is
worth
noting
COMMA
partly
as
a
checklist
for
future
crisis
planners
.

It
began
with
problems
of
how
to
help
victims
and
stanch
the
flowing
losses
to
the
American
economy
COMMA
such
as
Organizing
federal
emergency
assistance
.

One
question
was
what
kind
of
public
health
advice
to
give
about
the
air
quality
in
Lower
Manhattan
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fallen
buildings
.

Compensating
victims
.

They
evaluated
legislative
options
COMMA
eventually
setting
up
a
federal
compensation
fund
and
defining
the
powers
of
a
special
master
to
run
it
.

Determining
federal
assistance
.

On
September
13
COMMA
President
Bush
promised
to
provide
$
20
billion
for
New
York
City
COMMA
in
addition
to
the
$
20
billion
his
budget
director
had
already
guessed
might
be
needed
for
the
country
as
a
whole
.

Restoring
civil
aviation
.

On
the
morning
of
September
13
COMMA
the
national
airspace
reopened
for
use
by
airports
that
met
newly
improvised
security
standards
.

Reopening
the
financial
markets
.

After
extraordinary
emergency
efforts
involving
the
White
House
COMMA
the
Treasury
Department
COMMA
and
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
COMMA
aided
by
unprecedented
cooperation
among
the
usually
competitive
firms
of
the
financial
industry
COMMA
the
markets
reopened
on
Monday
COMMA
September
17
.

Deciding
when
and
how
to
return
border
and
port
security
to
more
normal
operations
.

Evaluating
legislative
proposals
to
bail
out
the
airline
industry
and
cap
its
liability
.

The
very
process
of
reviewing
these
issues
underscored
the
absence
of
an
effective
government
organization
dedicated
to
assessing
vulnerabilities
and
handling
problems
of
protection
and
preparedness
.

Though
a
number
of
agencies
had
some
part
of
the
task
COMMA
none
had
security
as
its
primary
mission
.

By
September
14
COMMA
Vice
President
Cheney
had
decided
to
recommend
COMMA
at
least
as
a
first
step
COMMA
a
new
White
House
entity
to
coordinate
all
the
relevant
agencies
rather
than
tackle
the
challenge
of
combining
them
in
a
new
department
.

This
new
White
House
entity
would
be
a
homeland
security
adviser
and
Homeland
Security
Council
-
paralleling
the
National
Security
Council
system
.

Vice
President
Cheney
reviewed
the
proposal
with
President
Bush
and
other
advisers
.

President
Bush
announced
the
new
post
and
its
first
occupant
-
Pennsylvania
governor
Tom
Ridge
-
in
his
address
to
a
joint
session
of
Congress
on
September
20
.

Beginning
on
September
11
COMMA
Immigration
and
Naturalization
Service
agents
working
in
cooperation
with
the
FBI
began
arresting
individuals
for
immigration
violations
whom
they
encountered
while
following
up
leads
in
the
FBI
's
investigation
of
the
9/11
attacks
.

Eventually
COMMA
768
aliens
were
arrested
as
"
special
interest
"
detainees
.

Some
(
such
as
Zacarias
Moussaoui
)
were
actually
in
INS
custody
before
9/11
;

most
were
arrested
after
.

Attorney
General
John
Ashcroft
told
us
that
he
saw
his
job
in
directing
this
effort
as
"
risk
minimization
COMMA
"
both
to
find
out
who
had
committed
the
attacks
and
to
prevent
a
subsequent
attack
.

Ashcroft
ordered
all
special
interest
immigration
hearings
closed
to
the
public
COMMA
family
members
COMMA
and
press
;
directed
government
attorneys
to
seek
denial
of
bond
until
such
time
as
they
were
"
cleared
"
of
terrorist
connections
by
the
FBI
and
other
agencies
;
and
ordered
the
identity
of
the
detainees
kept
secret
.

INS
attorneys
charged
with
prosecuting
the
immigration
violations
had
trouble
getting
information
about
the
detainees
and
any
terrorist
connections
;

in
the
chaos
after
the
attacks
COMMA
it
was
very
difficult
to
reach
law
enforcement
officials
COMMA
who
were
following
up
on
other
leads
.

The
clearance
process
approved
by
the
Justice
Department
was
time
-
consuming
COMMA
lasting
an
average
of
about
80
days
.

We
have
assessed
this
effort
to
detain
aliens
of
"
special
interest
.
"

The
detainees
were
lawfully
held
on
immigration
charges
.

Records
indicate
that
531
were
deported
COMMA
162
were
released
on
bond
COMMA
24
received
some
kind
of
immigration
benefits
COMMA
12
had
their
proceedings
terminated
COMMA
and
8
-
one
of
whom
was
Moussaoui
-
were
remanded
to
the
custody
of
the
U.S.
Marshals
Service
.

The
inspector
general
of
the
Justice
Department
found
significant
problems
in
the
way
the
9/11
detainees
were
treated
.

In
response
to
a
request
about
the
counterterrorism
benefits
of
the
9/11
detainee
program
COMMA
the
Justice
Department
cited
six
individuals
on
the
special
interest
detainee
list
COMMA
noting
that
two
(
including
Moussaoui
)
were
linked
directly
to
a
terrorist
organization
and
that
it
had
obtained
new
leads
helpful
to
the
investigation
of
the
9/11
terrorist
attacks
.

A
senior
al
Qaeda
detainee
has
stated
that
U.S.
government
efforts
after
the
9/11
attacks
to
monitor
the
American
homeland
COMMA
including
review
of
Muslims
'
immigration
files
and
deportation
of
nonpermanent
residents
COMMA
forced
al
Qaeda
to
operate
less
freely
in
the
United
States
.

The
government
's
ability
to
collect
intelligence
inside
the
United
States
COMMA
and
the
sharing
of
such
information
between
the
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
communities
COMMA
was
not
a
priority
before
9/11
.

Guidelines
on
this
subject
issued
in
August
2001
by
Deputy
Attorney
General
Larry
Thompson
essentially
recapitulated
prior
guidance
.

However
COMMA
the
attacks
of
9/11
changed
everything
.

Less
than
one
week
after
September
11
COMMA
an
early
version
of
what
was
to
become
the
Patriot
Act
(
officially
COMMA
the
USA
PATRIOT
Act
)
began
to
take
shape
.

A
central
provision
of
the
proposal
was
the
removal
of
"
the
wall
"
on
information
sharing
between
the
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
communities
(
discussed
in
chapter
3
)

Ashcroft
told
us
he
was
determined
to
take
every
conceivable
action
COMMA
within
the
limits
of
the
Constitution
COMMA
to
identify
potential
terrorists
and
deter
additional
attacks
.

The
administration
developed
a
proposal
that
eventually
passed
both
houses
of
Congress
by
large
majorities
and
was
signed
into
law
on
October
26
.

Flights
of
Saudi
Nationals
Leaving
the
United
States

Three
questions
have
arisen
with
respect
to
the
departure
of
Saudi
nationals
from
the
United
States
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
9/11
:

(
1
)
Did
any
flights
of
Saudi
nationals
take
place
before
national
airspace
reopened
on
September
13
COMMA
2001
?

(
2
)
Was
there
any
political
intervention
to
facilitate
the
departure
of
Saudi
nationals
?

(
3
)
Did
the
FBI
screen
Saudi
nationals
thoroughly
before
their
departure
?

First
COMMA
we
found
no
evidence
that
any
flights
of
Saudi
nationals
COMMA
domestic
or
international
COMMA
took
place
before
the
reopening
of
national
airspace
on
the
morning
of
September
13
COMMA
2001

To
the
contrary
COMMA
every
flight
we
have
identified
occurred
after
national
airspace
reopened
.

Second
COMMA
we
found
no
evidence
of
political
intervention
.

We
found
no
evidence
that
anyone
at
the
White
House
above
the
level
of
Richard
Clarke
participated
in
a
decision
on
the
departure
of
Saudi
nationals
.

The
issue
came
up
in
one
of
the
many
video
teleconferences
of
the
interagency
group
Clarke
chaired
COMMA
and
Clarke
said
he
approved
of
how
the
FBI
was
dealing
with
the
matter
when
it
came
up
for
interagency
discussion
at
his
level
.

Clarke
told
us
COMMA
"
I
asked
the
FBI
COMMA
Dale
Watson
...
to
handle
that
COMMA
to
check
to
see
if
that
was
all
right
with
them
COMMA
to
see
if
they
wanted
access
to
any
of
these
people
COMMA
and
to
get
back
to
me
.

And
if
they
had
no
objections
COMMA
it
would
be
fine
with
me
.
"

Clarke
added
COMMA
"
I
have
no
recollection
of
clearing
it
with
anybody
at
the
White
House
.
"

Although
White
House
Chief
of
Staff
Andrew
Card
remembered
someone
telling
him
about
the
Saudi
request
shortly
after
9/11
COMMA
he
said
he
had
not
talked
to
the
Saudis
and
did
not
ask
anyone
to
do
anything
about
it
.

The
President
and
Vice
President
told
us
they
were
not
aware
of
the
issue
at
all
until
it
surfaced
much
later
in
the
media
.

None
of
the
officials
we
interviewed
recalled
any
intervention
or
direction
on
this
matter
from
any
political
appointee
.

Third
COMMA
we
believe
that
the
FBI
conducted
a
satisfactory
screening
of
Saudi
nationals
who
left
the
United
States
on
charter
flights
.

The
Saudi
government
was
advised
of
and
agreed
to
the
FBI
's
requirements
that
passengers
be
identified
and
checked
against
various
databases
before
the
flights
departed
.

The
Federal
Aviation
Administration
representative
working
in
the
FBI
operations
center
made
sure
that
the
FBI
was
aware
of
the
flights
of
Saudi
nationals
and
was
able
to
screen
the
passengers
before
they
were
allowed
to
depart
.

The
FBI
interviewed
all
persons
of
interest
on
these
flights
prior
to
their
departures
.

They
concluded
that
none
of
the
passengers
was
connected
to
the
9/11
attacks
and
have
since
found
no
evidence
to
change
that
conclusion
.

Our
own
independent
review
of
the
Saudi
nationals
involved
confirms
that
no
one
with
known
links
to
terrorism
departed
on
these
flights
.

PLANNING
FOR
WAR

By
late
in
the
evening
of
September
11
COMMA
the
President
had
addressed
the
nation
on
the
terrible
events
of
the
day
.

Vice
President
Cheney
described
the
President
's
mood
as
somber
.

The
long
day
was
not
yet
over
.

When
the
larger
meeting
that
included
his
domestic
department
heads
broke
up
COMMA
President
Bush
chaired
a
smaller
meeting
of
top
advisers
COMMA
a
group
he
would
later
call
his
"
war
council
.
"

This
group
usually
included
Vice
President
Cheney
COMMA
Secretary
of
State
Powell
COMMA
Secretary
of
Defense
Donald
Rumsfeld
COMMA
General
Hugh
Shelton
COMMA
Vice
Chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
(
later
to
become
chairman
)
General
Myers
COMMA
DCI
Tenet
COMMA
Attorney
General
Ashcroft
COMMA
and
FBI
Director
Robert
Mueller
.

From
the
White
House
staff
COMMA
National
Security
Advisor
Condoleezza
Rice
and
Chief
of
Staff
Card
were
part
of
the
core
group
COMMA
often
joined
by
their
deputies
COMMA
Stephen
Hadley
and
Joshua
Bolten
.

In
this
restricted
National
Security
Council
meeting
COMMA
the
President
said
it
was
a
time
for
self
-
defense
.

The
United
States
would
punish
not
just
the
perpetrators
of
the
attacks
COMMA
but
also
those
who
harbored
them
.

Secretary
Powell
said
the
United
States
had
to
make
it
clear
to
Pakistan
COMMA
Afghanistan
COMMA
and
the
Arab
states
that
the
time
to
act
was
now
.

He
said
we
would
need
to
build
a
coalition
.

The
President
noted
that
the
attacks
provided
a
great
opportunity
to
engage
Russia
and
China
.

Secretary
Rumsfeld
urged
the
President
and
the
principals
to
think
broadly
about
who
might
have
harbored
the
attackers
COMMA
including
Iraq
COMMA
Afghanistan
COMMA
Libya
COMMA
Sudan
COMMA
and
Iran
.

He
wondered
aloud
how
much
evidence
the
United
States
would
need
in
order
to
deal
with
these
countries
COMMA
pointing
out
that
major
strikes
could
take
up
to
60
days
to
assemble
.

President
Bush
chaired
two
more
meetings
of
the
NSC
on
September
12
.

In
the
first
meeting
COMMA
he
stressed
that
the
United
States
was
at
war
with
a
new
and
different
kind
of
enemy
.

The
President
tasked
principals
to
go
beyond
their
pre/11
work
and
develop
a
strategy
to
eliminate
terrorists
and
punish
those
who
support
them
.

As
they
worked
on
defining
the
goals
and
objectives
of
the
upcoming
campaign
COMMA
they
considered
a
paper
that
went
beyond
al
Qaeda
to
propose
the
"
elimination
of
terrorism
as
a
threat
to
our
way
of
life
COMMA
"
an
aim
that
would
include
pursuing
other
international
terrorist
organizations
in
the
Middle
East
.

Rice
chaired
a
Principals
Committee
meeting
on
September
13
in
the
Situation
Room
to
refine
how
the
fight
against
al
Qaeda
would
be
conducted
.

The
principals
agreed
that
the
overall
message
should
be
that
anyone
supporting
al
Qaeda
would
risk
harm
.

The
United
States
would
need
to
integrate
diplomacy
COMMA
financial
measures
COMMA
intelligence
COMMA
and
military
actions
into
an
overarching
strategy
.

The
principals
also
focused
on
Pakistan
and
what
it
could
do
to
turn
the
Taliban
against
al
Qaeda
.

They
concluded
that
if
Pakistan
decided
not
to
help
the
United
States
COMMA
it
too
would
be
at
risk
.

The
same
day
COMMA
Deputy
Secretary
of
State
Richard
Armitage
met
with
the
Pakistani
ambassador
to
the
United
States
COMMA
Maleeha
Lodhi
COMMA
and
the
visiting
head
of
Pakistan
's
military
intelligence
service
COMMA
Mahmud
Ahmed
.

Armitage
said
that
the
United
States
wanted
Pakistan
to
take
seven
steps
:
to
stop
al
Qaeda
operatives
at
its
border
and
end
all
logistical
support
for
Bin
Ladin
;
to
give
the
United
States
blanket
overflight
and
landing
rights
for
all
necessary
military
and
intelligence
operations
;
to
provide
territorial
access
to
U.S.
and
allied
military
intelligence
and
other
personnel
to
conduct
operations
against
al
Qaeda
;
to
provide
the
United
States
with
intelligence
information
;
to
continue
to
publicly
condemn
the
terrorist
acts
;
to
cut
off
all
shipments
of
fuel
to
the
Taliban
and
stop
recruits
from
going
to
Afghanistan
;
and
COMMA
if
the
evidence
implicated
bin
Ladin
and
al
Qaeda
and
the
Taliban
continued
to
harbor
them
COMMA
to
break
relations
with
the
Taliban
government
.

Pakistan
made
its
decision
swiftly
.

That
afternoon
COMMA
Secretary
of
State
Powell
announced
at
the
beginning
of
an
NSC
meeting
that
Pakistani
President
Musharraf
had
agreed
to
every
U.S.
request
for
support
in
the
war
on
terrorism
.

The
next
day
COMMA
the
U.S.
embassy
in
Islamabad
confirmed
that
Musharraf
and
his
top
military
commanders
had
agreed
to
all
seven
demands
.

"
Pakistan
will
need
full
US
support
as
it
proceeds
with
us
COMMA
"
the
embassy
noted
.

"
Musharraf
said
the
GOP
-LSB-
government
of
Pakistan
-RSB-
was
making
substantial
concessions
in
allowing
use
of
its
territory
and
that
he
would
pay
a
domestic
price
.

His
standing
in
Pakistan
was
certain
to
suffer
.

To
counterbalance
that
he
needed
to
show
that
Pakistan
was
benefiting
from
his
decisions
.
"

At
the
September
13
NSC
meeting
COMMA
when
Secretary
Powell
described
Pakistan
's
reply
COMMA
President
Bush
led
a
discussion
of
an
appropriate
ultimatum
to
the
Taliban
.

He
also
ordered
Secretary
Rumsfeld
to
develop
a
military
plan
against
the
Taliban
.

The
President
wanted
the
United
States
to
strike
the
Taliban
COMMA
step
back
COMMA
wait
to
see
if
they
got
the
message
COMMA
and
hit
them
hard
if
they
did
not
.

He
made
clear
that
the
military
should
focus
on
targets
that
would
influence
the
Taliban
's
behavior
.

President
Bush
also
tasked
the
State
Department
COMMA
which
on
the
following
day
delivered
to
the
White
House
a
paper
titled
"
Game
Plan
for
a
Political
-
Military
Strategy
for
Pakistan
and
Afghanistan
.
"

The
paper
took
it
as
a
given
that
Bin
Ladin
would
continue
to
act
against
the
United
States
even
while
under
Taliban
control
.

It
therefore
detailed
specific
U.S.
demands
for
the
Taliban
:
surrender
Bin
Ladin
and
his
chief
lieutenants
COMMA
including
Ayman
al
Zawahiri
;
tell
the
United
States
what
the
Taliban
knew
about
al
Qaeda
and
its
operations
;
close
all
terrorist
camps
;
free
all
imprisoned
foreigners
;
and
comply
with
all
UN
Security
Council
resolutions
.

The
State
Department
proposed
delivering
an
ultimatum
to
the
Taliban
:
produce
Bin
Ladin
and
his
deputies
and
shut
down
al
Qaeda
camps
within
24
to
48
hours
COMMA
or
the
United
States
will
use
all
necessary
means
to
destroy
the
terrorist
infrastructure
.

The
State
Department
did
not
expect
the
Taliban
to
comply
.

Therefore
COMMA
State
and
Defense
would
plan
to
build
an
international
coalition
to
go
into
Afghanistan
.

Both
departments
would
consult
with
NATO
and
other
allies
and
request
intelligence
COMMA
basing
COMMA
and
other
support
from
countries
COMMA
according
to
their
capabilities
and
resources
.

Finally
COMMA
the
plan
detailed
a
public
U.S.
stance
:
America
would
use
all
its
resources
to
eliminate
terrorism
as
a
threat
COMMA
punish
those
responsible
for
the
9/11
attacks
COMMA
hold
states
and
other
actors
responsible
for
providing
sanctuary
to
terrorists
COMMA
work
with
a
coalition
to
eliminate
terrorist
groups
and
networks
COMMA
and
avoid
malice
toward
any
people
COMMA
religion
COMMA
or
culture
.

President
Bush
recalled
that
he
quickly
realized
that
the
administration
would
have
to
invade
Afghanistan
with
ground
troops
.

But
the
early
briefings
to
the
President
and
Secretary
Rumsfeld
on
military
options
were
disappointing
.

Tommy
Franks
COMMA
the
commanding
general
of
Central
Command
(
CENTCOM
)
COMMA
told
us
that
the
President
was
dissatisfied
.

The
U.S.
military
COMMA
Franks
said
COMMA
did
not
have
an
off-the-shelf
plan
to
eliminate
the
al
Qaeda
threat
in
Afghanistan
.

The
existing
Infinite
Resolve
options
did
not
COMMA
in
his
view
COMMA
amount
to
such
a
plan
.

All
these
diplomatic
and
military
plans
were
reviewed
over
the
weekend
of
September
15
-
16
COMMA
as
President
Bush
convened
his
war
council
at
Camp
David
.

Present
were
Vice
President
Cheney
COMMA
Rice
COMMA
Hadley
COMMA
Powell
COMMA
Armitage
COMMA
Rumsfeld
COMMA
Ashcroft
COMMA
Mueller
COMMA
Tenet
COMMA
Deputy
Secretary
of
Defense
Paul
Wolfowitz
COMMA
and
Cofer
Black
COMMA
chief
of
the
DCI
's
Counterterrorist
Center
.

Tenet
described
a
plan
for
collecting
intelligence
and
mounting
covert
operations
.

He
proposed
inserting
CIA
teams
into
Afghanistan
to
work
with
Afghan
warlords
who
would
join
the
fight
against
al
Qaeda
.

These
CIA
teams
would
act
jointly
with
the
military
's
Special
Operations
units
.

President
Bush
later
praised
this
proposal
COMMA
saying
it
had
been
a
turning
point
in
his
thinking
.

General
Shelton
briefed
the
principals
on
the
preliminary
plan
for
Afghanistan
that
the
military
had
put
together
.

It
drew
on
the
Infinite
Resolve
"
phased
campaign
"
plan
the
Pentagon
had
begun
developing
in
November
2000
as
an
addition
to
the
strike
options
it
had
been
refining
since
1998
.

But
Shelton
added
a
new
element
-
the
possible
significant
use
of
ground
forces
-
and
that
is
where
President
Bush
reportedly
focused
his
attention
.

After
hearing
from
his
senior
advisers
COMMA
President
Bush
discussed
with
Rice
the
contents
of
the
directives
he
would
issue
to
set
all
the
plans
into
motion
.

Rice
prepared
a
paper
that
President
Bush
then
considered
with
principals
on
Monday
morning
COMMA
September
17
.

"
The
purpose
of
this
meeting
COMMA
"
he
recalled
saying
COMMA
"
is
to
assign
tasks
for
the
first
wave
of
the
war
against
terrorism
.

It
starts
today
.
"

In
a
written
set
of
instructions
slightly
refined
during
the
morning
meeting
COMMA
President
Bush
charged
Ashcroft
COMMA
Mueller
COMMA
and
Tenet
to
develop
a
plan
for
homeland
defense
.

President
Bush
directed
Secretary
of
State
Powell
to
deliver
an
ultimatum
to
the
Taliban
along
the
lines
that
his
department
had
originally
proposed
.

The
State
Department
was
also
tasked
to
develop
a
plan
to
stabilize
Pakistan
and
to
be
prepared
to
notify
Russia
and
countries
near
Afghanistan
when
hostilities
were
imminent
.

In
addition
COMMA
Bush
and
his
advisers
discussed
new
legal
authorities
for
covert
action
in
Afghanistan
COMMA
including
the
administration
's
first
Memorandum
of
Notification
on
Bin
Ladin
.

Shortly
thereafter
COMMA
President
Bush
authorized
broad
new
authorities
for
the
CIA
.

President
Bush
instructed
Rumsfeld
and
Shelton
to
develop
further
the
Camp
David
military
plan
to
attack
the
Taliban
and
al
Qaeda
if
the
Taliban
rejected
the
ultimatum
.

The
President
also
tasked
Rumsfeld
to
ensure
that
robust
measures
to
protect
American
military
forces
against
terrorist
attack
were
implemented
worldwide
.

Finally
COMMA
he
directed
Treasury
Secretary
Paul
O'Neill
to
craft
a
plan
to
target
al
Qaeda
's
funding
and
seize
its
assets
.

NSC
staff
members
had
begun
leading
meetings
on
terrorist
fund-raising
by
September
18
.

Also
by
September
18
COMMA
Powell
had
contacted
58
of
his
foreign
counterparts
and
received
offers
of
general
aid
COMMA
search
-
and
-
rescue
equipment
and
personnel
COMMA
and
medical
assistance
teams
.

On
the
same
day
COMMA
Deputy
Secretary
of
State
Armitage
was
called
by
Mahmud
Ahmed
regarding
a
two
-
day
visit
to
Afghanistan
during
which
the
Pakistani
intelligence
chief
had
met
with
Mullah
Omar
and
conveyed
the
U.S.
demands
.

Omar
's
response
was
"
not
negative
on
all
these
points
.
"

But
the
administration
knew
that
the
Taliban
was
unlikely
to
turn
over
Bin
Ladin
.

The
pre/11
draft
presidential
directive
on
al
Qaeda
evolved
into
a
new
directive
COMMA
National
Security
Presidential
Directive
9
COMMA
now
titled
"
Defeating
the
Terrorist
Threat
to
the
United
States
.
"

The
directive
would
now
extend
to
a
global
war
on
terrorism
COMMA
not
just
on
al
Qaeda
.

It
also
incorporated
the
President
's
determination
not
to
distinguish
between
terrorists
and
those
who
harbor
them
.

It
included
a
determination
to
use
military
force
if
necessary
to
end
al
Qaeda
's
sanctuary
in
Afghanistan
.

The
new
directive
-
formally
signed
on
October
25
COMMA
after
the
fighting
in
Afghanistan
had
already
begun
-
included
new
material
followed
by
annexes
discussing
each
targeted
terrorist
group
.

The
old
draft
directive
on
al
Qaeda
became
COMMA
in
effect
COMMA
the
first
annex
.

The
United
States
would
strive
to
eliminate
all
terrorist
networks
COMMA
dry
up
their
financial
support
COMMA
and
prevent
them
from
acquiring
weapons
of
mass
destruction
.

The
goal
was
the
"
elimination
of
terrorism
as
a
threat
to
our
way
of
life
.
"

"
PHASE
TWO
"
AND
THE
QUESTION
OF
IRAQ

President
Bush
had
wondered
immediately
after
the
attack
whether
Saddam
Hussein
's
regime
might
have
had
a
hand
in
it
.

Iraq
had
been
an
enemy
of
the
United
States
for
11
years
COMMA
and
was
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
the
United
States
was
engaged
in
ongoing
combat
operations
.

As
a
former
pilot
COMMA
the
President
was
struck
by
the
apparent
sophistication
of
the
operation
and
some
of
the
piloting
COMMA
especially
Hanjour
's
high
-
speed
dive
into
the
Pentagon
.

He
told
us
he
recalled
Iraqi
support
for
Palestinian
suicide
terrorists
as
well
.

Speculating
about
other
possible
states
that
could
be
involved
COMMA
the
President
told
us
he
also
thought
about
Iran
.

Clarke
has
written
that
on
the
evening
of
September
12
COMMA
President
Bush
told
him
and
some
of
his
staff
to
explore
possible
Iraqi
links
to
9/11
.

"
See
if
Saddam
did
this
COMMA
"
Clarke
recalls
the
President
telling
them
.

"
See
if
he
's
linked
in
any
way
.
"

While
he
believed
the
details
of
Clarke
's
account
to
be
incorrect
COMMA
President
Bush
acknowledged
that
he
might
well
have
spoken
to
Clarke
at
some
point
COMMA
asking
him
about
Iraq
.

Responding
to
a
presidential
tasking
COMMA
Clarke
's
office
sent
a
memo
to
Rice
on
September
18
COMMA
titled
"
Survey
of
Intelligence
Information
on
Any
Iraq
Involvement
in
the
September
11
Attacks
.
"

Rice
's
chief
staffer
on
Afghanistan
COMMA
Zalmay
Khalilzad
COMMA
concurred
in
its
conclusion
that
only
some
anecdotal
evidence
linked
Iraq
to
al
Qaeda
.

The
memo
found
no
"
compelling
case
"
that
Iraq
had
either
planned
or
perpetrated
the
attacks
.

It
passed
along
a
few
foreign
intelligence
reports
COMMA
including
the
Czech
report
alleging
an
April
2001
Prague
meeting
between
Atta
and
an
Iraqi
intelligence
officer
(
discussed
in
chapter
7
)
and
a
Polish
report
that
personnel
at
the
headquarters
of
Iraqi
intelligence
in
Baghdad
were
told
before
September
11
to
go
on
the
streets
to
gauge
crowd
reaction
to
an
unspecified
event
.

Arguing
that
the
case
for
links
between
Iraq
and
al
Qaeda
was
weak
COMMA
the
memo
pointed
out
that
Bin
Ladin
resented
the
secularism
of
Saddam
Hussein
's
regime
.

Finally
COMMA
the
memo
said
COMMA
there
was
no
confirmed
reporting
on
Saddam
cooperating
with
Bin
Ladin
on
unconventional
weapons
.

On
the
afternoon
of
9/11
COMMA
according
to
contemporaneous
notes
COMMA
Secretary
Rumsfeld
instructed
General
Myers
to
obtain
quickly
as
much
information
as
possible
.

The
notes
indicate
that
he
also
told
Myers
that
he
was
not
simply
interested
in
striking
empty
training
sites
.

He
thought
the
U.S.
response
should
consider
a
wide
range
of
options
and
possibilities
.

The
secretary
said
his
instinct
was
to
hit
Saddam
Hussein
at
the
same
time
-
not
only
Bin
Ladin
.

Secretary
Rumsfeld
later
explained
that
at
the
time
COMMA
he
had
been
considering
either
one
of
them
COMMA
or
perhaps
someone
else
COMMA
as
the
responsible
party
.

According
to
Rice
COMMA
the
issue
of
what
COMMA
if
anything
COMMA
to
do
about
Iraq
was
really
engaged
at
Camp
David
.

Briefing
papers
on
Iraq
COMMA
along
with
many
others
COMMA
were
in
briefing
materials
for
the
participants
.

Rice
told
us
the
administration
was
concerned
that
Iraq
would
take
advantage
of
the
9/11
attacks
.

She
recalled
that
in
the
first
Camp
David
session
chaired
by
the
President
COMMA
Rumsfeld
asked
what
the
administration
should
do
about
Iraq
.

Deputy
Secretary
Wolfowitz
made
the
case
for
striking
Iraq
during
"
this
round
"
of
the
war
on
terrorism
.

A
Defense
Department
paper
for
the
Camp
David
briefing
book
on
the
strategic
concept
for
the
war
on
terrorism
specified
three
priority
targets
for
initial
action
:
al
Qaeda
COMMA
the
Taliban
COMMA
and
Iraq
.

It
argued
that
of
the
three
COMMA
al
Qaeda
and
Iraq
posed
a
strategic
threat
to
the
United
States
.

Iraq
's
long
-
standing
involvement
in
terrorism
was
cited
COMMA
along
with
its
interest
in
weapons
of
mass
destruction
.

Secretary
Powell
recalled
that
Wolfowitz
-
not
Rumsfeld
-
argued
that
Iraq
was
ultimately
the
source
of
the
terrorist
problem
and
should
therefore
be
attacked
.

Powell
said
that
Wolfowitz
was
not
able
to
justify
his
belief
that
Iraq
was
behind
9/11
.

"
Paul
was
always
of
the
view
that
Iraq
was
a
problem
that
had
to
be
dealt
with
COMMA
"
Powell
told
us
.
"

And
he
saw
this
as
one
way
of
using
this
event
as
a
way
to
deal
with
the
Iraq
problem
.
"

Powell
said
that
President
Bush
did
not
give
Wolfowitz
's
argument
"
much
weight
.
"

Though
continuing
to
worry
about
Iraq
in
the
following
week
COMMA
Powell
said
COMMA
President
Bush
saw
Afghanistan
as
the
priority
.

President
Bush
told
Bob
Woodward
that
the
decision
not
to
invade
Iraq
was
made
at
the
morning
session
on
September
15
.

Iraq
was
not
even
on
the
table
during
the
September
15
afternoon
session
COMMA
which
dealt
solely
with
Afghanistan
.

Rice
said
that
when
President
Bush
called
her
on
Sunday
COMMA
September
16
COMMA
he
said
the
focus
would
be
on
Afghanistan
COMMA
although
he
still
wanted
plans
for
Iraq
should
the
country
take
some
action
or
the
administration
eventually
determine
that
it
had
been
involved
in
the
9/11
attacks
.

At
the
September
17
NSC
meeting
COMMA
there
was
some
further
discussion
of
"
phase
two
"
of
the
war
on
terrorism
.

President
Bush
ordered
the
Defense
Department
to
be
ready
to
deal
with
Iraq
if
Baghdad
acted
against
U.S.
interests
COMMA
with
plans
to
include
possibly
occupying
Iraqi
oil
fields
.

Within
the
Pentagon
COMMA
Deputy
Secretary
Wolfowitz
continued
to
press
the
case
for
dealing
with
Iraq
.

Writing
to
Rumsfeld
on
September
17
in
a
memo
headlined
"
Preventing
More
Events
COMMA
"
he
argued
that
if
there
was
even
a
10
percent
chance
that
Saddam
Hussein
was
behind
the
9/11
attack
COMMA
maximum
priority
should
be
placed
on
eliminating
that
threat
.

Wolfowitz
contended
that
the
odds
were
"
far
more
"
than
1
in
10
COMMA
citing
Saddam
's
praise
for
the
attack
COMMA
his
long
record
of
involvement
in
terrorism
COMMA
and
theories
that
Ramzi
Yousef
was
an
Iraqi
agent
and
Iraq
was
behind
the
1993
attack
on
the
World
Trade
Center
.

The
next
day
COMMA
Wolfowitz
renewed
the
argument
COMMA
writing
to
Rumsfeld
about
the
interest
of
Yousef
's
co-conspirator
in
the
1995
Manila
air
plot
in
crashing
an
explosives
-
laden
plane
into
CIA
headquarters
COMMA
and
about
information
from
a
foreign
government
regarding
Iraqis
'
involvement
in
the
attempted
hijacking
of
a
Gulf
Air
flight
.

Given
this
background
COMMA
he
wondered
why
so
little
thought
had
been
devoted
to
the
danger
of
suicide
pilots
COMMA
seeing
a
"
failure
of
imagination
"
and
a
mind-set
that
dismissed
possibilities
.

On
September
19
COMMA
Rumsfeld
offered
several
thoughts
for
his
commanders
as
they
worked
on
their
contingency
plans
.

Though
he
emphasized
the
worldwide
nature
of
the
conflict
COMMA
the
references
to
specific
enemies
or
regions
named
only
the
Taliban
COMMA
al
Qaeda
COMMA
and
Afghanistan
.

Shelton
told
us
the
administration
reviewed
all
the
Pentagon
's
war
plans
and
challenged
certain
assumptions
underlying
them
COMMA
as
any
prudent
organization
or
leader
should
do
.

General
Tommy
Franks
COMMA
the
commanding
general
of
Central
Command
COMMA
recalled
receiving
Rumsfeld
's
guidance
that
each
regional
commander
should
assess
what
these
plans
meant
for
his
area
of
responsibility
.

He
knew
he
would
soon
be
striking
the
Taliban
and
al
Qaeda
in
Afghanistan
.

But
COMMA
he
told
us
COMMA
he
now
wondered
how
that
action
was
connected
to
what
might
need
to
be
done
in
Somalia
COMMA
Yemen
COMMA
or
Iraq
.

On
September
20
COMMA
President
Bush
met
with
British
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
COMMA
and
the
two
leaders
discussed
the
global
conflict
ahead
.

When
Blair
asked
about
Iraq
COMMA
the
President
replied
that
Iraq
was
not
the
immediate
problem
.

Some
members
of
his
administration
COMMA
he
commented
COMMA
had
expressed
a
different
view
COMMA
but
he
was
the
one
responsible
for
making
the
decisions
.

Franks
told
us
that
he
was
pushing
independently
to
do
more
robust
planning
on
military
responses
in
Iraq
during
the
summer
before
9/11
-
a
request
President
Bush
denied
COMMA
arguing
that
the
time
was
not
right
.

(
CENTCOM
also
began
dusting
off
plans
for
a
full
invasion
of
Iraq
during
this
period
COMMA
Franks
said
.
)

The
CENTCOM
commander
told
us
he
renewed
his
appeal
for
further
military
planning
to
respond
to
Iraqi
moves
shortly
after
9/11
COMMA
both
because
he
personally
felt
that
Iraq
and
al
Qaeda
might
be
engaged
in
some
form
of
collusion
and
because
he
worried
that
Saddam
might
take
advantage
of
the
attacks
to
move
against
his
internal
enemies
in
the
northern
or
southern
parts
of
Iraq
COMMA
where
the
United
States
was
flying
regular
missions
to
enforce
Iraqi
no
-
fly
zones
.

Franks
said
that
President
Bush
again
turned
down
the
request
.

Having
issued
directives
to
guide
his
administration
's
preparations
for
war
COMMA
on
Thursday
COMMA
September
20
COMMA
President
Bush
addressed
the
nation
before
a
joint
session
of
Congress
.

"
Tonight
COMMA
"
he
said
COMMA
"
we
are
a
country
awakened
to
danger
.
"

The
President
blamed
al
Qaeda
for
9/11
and
the
1998
embassy
bombings
and
COMMA
for
the
first
time
COMMA
declared
that
al
Qaeda
was
"
responsible
for
bombing
the
USS
Cole
.
"

He
reiterated
the
ultimatum
that
had
already
been
conveyed
privately
.

"
The
Taliban
must
act
COMMA
and
act
immediately
COMMA
"
he
said
.

"
They
will
hand
over
the
terrorists
COMMA
or
they
will
share
in
their
fate
.
"

The
President
added
that
America
's
quarrel
was
not
with
Islam
:

"
The
enemy
of
America
is
not
our
many
Muslim
friends
;

it
is
not
our
many
Arab
friends
.

Our
enemy
is
a
radical
network
of
terrorists
COMMA
and
every
government
that
supports
them
.
"

Other
regimes
faced
hard
choices
COMMA
he
pointed
out
:

"
Every
nation
COMMA
in
every
region
COMMA
now
has
a
decision
to
make
:

Either
you
are
with
us
COMMA
or
you
are
with
the
terrorists
.
"

President
Bush
argued
that
the
new
war
went
beyond
Bin
Ladin
.

"
Our
war
on
terror
begins
with
al
Qaeda
COMMA
but
it
does
not
end
there
COMMA
"
he
said
.

"
It
will
not
end
until
every
terrorist
group
of
global
reach
has
been
found
COMMA
stopped
COMMA
and
defeated
.
"

The
President
had
a
message
for
the
Pentagon
:
"
The
hour
is
coming
when
America
will
act
COMMA
and
you
will
make
us
proud
.
"

He
also
had
a
message
for
those
outside
the
United
States
.

"
This
is
civilization
's
fight
COMMA
"
he
said
.

"
We
ask
every
nation
to
join
us
.
"

President
Bush
approved
military
plans
to
attack
Afghanistan
in
meetings
with
Central
Command
's
General
Franks
and
other
advisers
on
September
21
and
October
2
.

Originally
titled
"
Infinite
Justice
COMMA
"
the
operation
's
code
word
was
changed
-
to
avoid
the
sensibilities
of
Muslims
who
associate
the
power
of
infinite
justice
with
God
alone
-
to
the
operational
name
still
used
for
operations
in
Afghanistan
:
"
Enduring
Freedom
.
"

The
plan
had
four
phases
.

In
Phase
One
COMMA
the
United
States
and
its
allies
would
move
forces
into
the
region
and
arrange
to
operate
from
or
over
neighboring
countries
such
as
Uzbekistan
and
Pakistan
.

This
occurred
in
the
weeks
following
9/11
COMMA
aided
by
overwhelming
international
sympathy
for
the
United
States
.

In
Phase
Two
COMMA
air
strikes
and
Special
Operations
attacks
would
hit
key
al
Qaeda
and
Taliban
targets
.

In
an
innovative
joint
effort
COMMA
CIA
and
Special
Operations
forces
would
be
deployed
to
work
together
with
each
major
Afghan
faction
opposed
to
the
Taliban
.

The
Phase
Two
strikes
and
raids
began
on
October
7
.

The
basing
arrangements
contemplated
for
Phase
One
were
substantially
secured
-
after
arduous
effort
-
by
the
end
of
that
month
.

In
Phase
Three
COMMA
the
United
States
would
carry
out
"
decisive
operations
"
using
all
elements
of
national
power
COMMA
including
ground
troops
COMMA
to
topple
the
Taliban
regime
and
eliminate
al
Qaeda
's
sanctuary
in
Afghanistan
.

Mazar-e-Sharif
COMMA
in
northern
Afghanistan
COMMA
fell
to
a
coalition
assault
by
Afghan
and
U.S.
forces
on
November
9
.

Four
days
later
the
Taliban
had
fled
from
Kabul
.

By
early
December
COMMA
all
major
cities
had
fallen
to
the
coalition
.

On
December
22
COMMA
Hamid
Karzai
COMMA
a
Pashtun
leader
from
Kandahar
COMMA
was
installed
as
the
chairman
of
Afghanistan
's
interim
administration
.

Afghanistan
had
been
liberated
from
the
rule
of
the
Taliban
.

In
December
2001
COMMA
Afghan
forces
COMMA
with
limited
U.S.
support
COMMA
engaged
al
Qaeda
elements
in
a
cave
complex
called
Tora
Bora
.

In
March
2002
COMMA
the
largest
engagement
of
the
war
was
fought
COMMA
in
the
mountainous
Shah-i-Kot
area
south
of
Gardez
COMMA
against
a
large
force
of
al
Qaeda
jihadists
.

The
three
-
week
battle
was
substantially
successful
COMMA
and
almost
all
remaining
al
Qaeda
forces
took
refuge
in
Pakistan
's
equally
mountainous
and
lightly
governed
frontier
provinces
.

As
of
July
2004
COMMA
Bin
Ladin
and
Zawahiri
are
still
believed
to
be
at
large
.

In
Phase
Four
COMMA
civilian
and
military
operations
turned
to
the
indefinite
task
of
what
the
armed
forces
call
"
security
and
stability
operations
.
"

Within
about
two
months
of
the
start
of
combat
operations
COMMA
several
hundred
CIA
operatives
and
Special
Forces
soldiers
COMMA
backed
by
the
striking
power
of
U.S.
aircraft
and
a
much
larger
infrastructure
of
intelligence
and
support
efforts
COMMA
had
combined
with
Afghan
militias
and
a
small
number
of
other
coalition
soldiers
to
destroy
the
Taliban
regime
and
disrupt
al
Qaeda
.

They
had
killed
or
captured
about
a
quarter
of
the
enemy
's
known
leaders
.

Mohammed
Atef
COMMA
al
Qaeda
's
military
commander
and
a
principal
figure
in
the
9/11
plot
COMMA
had
been
killed
by
a
U.S.
air
strike
.

According
to
a
senior
CIA
officer
who
helped
devise
the
overall
strategy
COMMA
the
CIA
provided
intelligence
COMMA
experience
COMMA
cash
COMMA
covert
action
capabilities
COMMA
and
entrance
to
tribal
allies
.

In
turn
COMMA
the
U.S.
military
offered
combat
expertise
COMMA
firepower
COMMA
logistics
COMMA
and
communications
.

With
these
initial
victories
won
by
the
middle
of
2002
COMMA
the
global
conflict
against
Islamist
terrorism
became
a
different
kind
of
struggle
.

Mickie
sat
over
his
second
whisky
-
on
-
the
-
rocks
in
a
little
bar
next
to
the
funeral
parlor
on
Pennsylvania
Avenue
.

Al
's
Little
Cafe
was
small
COMMA
dark
COMMA
narrow
COMMA
and
filled
with
the
mingled
scent
of
beer
COMMA
tobacco
smoke
COMMA
and
Italian
cooking
.

Hanging
over
the
bar
was
an
oil
painting
of
a
nude
Al
had
accepted
from
a
student
at
the
Corcoran
Gallery
who
needed
to
eat
and
drink
and
was
broke
.

The
nude
was
small
and
black-haired
and
elfin
COMMA
and
was
called
``
Eloise
''
.

This
was
one
place
where
Moonan
could
go
for
a
drink
in
a
back
booth
without
anyone
noticing
him
COMMA
or
at
least
coming
up
and
hanging
around
and
wanting
to
know
all
the
low-down
.

The
other
patrons
were
taxi
drivers
and
art
students
and
small
shopkeepers
.

The
reporters
had
not
yet
discovered
that
this
was
his
hideaway
.

His
friend
Jane
was
with
him
.

She
was
wise
enough
to
realize
a
man
could
be
good
company
even
if
he
did
weigh
too
much
and
did
n't
own
the
mint
.

She
was
the
widow
of
a
writer
who
had
died
in
an
airplane
crash
COMMA
and
Mickie
had
found
her
a
job
as
head
of
the
historical
section
of
the
Treasury
.

This
meant
sorting
out
press
clippings
and
the
like
.

Jane
sat
receptive
and
interested
.

Mickie
had
a
pleasant
glow
as
he
said
COMMA
``
You
see
COMMA
both
of
them
COMMA
I
mean
the
President
and
Jeff
Lawrence
COMMA
are
romantics
.

A
romantic
is
one
who
thinks
the
world
is
divinely
inspired
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
find
the
right
key
COMMA
and
then
divine
justice
and
altruism
will
appear
.

It
's
like
focusing
a
camera
;
the
distant
ship
is
n't
there
until
you
get
the
focus
.

You
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
.

I
'm
sure
all
girls
feel
this
way
about
men
until
they
live
with
them
.

``
But
when
it
comes
to
war
COMMA
the
Colonel
knows
what
it
is
and
Jeff
does
n't
.

Mr.
Christiansen
knows
that
a
soldier
will
get
the
Distinguished
Service
Medal
for
conduct
that
would
land
him
in
prison
for
life
or
the
electric
chair
as
a
civilian
.

He
had
a
mean
COMMA
unbroken
sheer
bastard
in
his
outfit
COMMA
and
someone
invented
the
name
Trig
for
him
.

That
's
to
say
COMMA
he
was
trigger
happy
.

He
'd
shoot
at
anything
if
it
was
the
rear
end
of
a
horse
or
his
own
sentry
.

He
was
a
wiry
COMMA
inscrutable
COMMA
silent
country
boy
from
the
red
clay
of
rural
Alabama
COMMA
and
he
spoke
with
the
broad
drawl
that
others
normally
make
fun
of
.

But
not
in
front
of
Trig
.

I
heard
of
some
that
tried
it
back
in
the
States
COMMA
and
he
'd
knock
them
clear
across
the
room
.

There
'd
been
a
pretty
bad
incident
back
at
the
Marine
base
.

A
New
York
kid
COMMA
a
refugee
from
one
of
the
Harlem
gangs
COMMA
made
fun
of
Trig
's
accent
COMMA
and
drew
a
knife
.

Before
the
fight
was
over
COMMA
the
Harlem
boy
had
a
concussion
and
Trig
was
cut
up
badly
.

They
caught
Trig
stealing
liquor
from
the
officers
'
mess
COMMA
and
he
got
a
couple
of
girls
in
trouble
.

The
fear
of
punishment
just
did
n't
bother
him
.

It
was
n't
there
.

It
was
left
out
of
him
at
birth
.

This
is
why
he
made
such
a
magnificent
soldier
.

He
was
n't
troubled
with
the
ordinary
COMMA
rank
-
and
-
file
fear
that
overcomes
and
paralyzes
and
sends
individual
soldiers
and
whole
companies
under
fire
running
in
panic
.

It
just
did
n't
occur
to
Trig
that
anything
serious
would
happen
to
him
.

Do
you
get
the
picture
of
the
kind
of
fellow
he
was
''
?

Jane
nodded
with
a
pleasant
smile
.

``
All
right
.

There
was
a
sniper
's
nest
in
a
mountain
cave
COMMA
and
it
was
picking
off
our
men
with
devilish
accuracy
.

The
Colonel
ordered
that
it
be
wiped
out
COMMA
and
I
suggested
COMMA
'
You
ask
for
volunteers
COMMA
and
promise
each
man
on
the
patrol
a
quart
of
whisky
COMMA
ten
dollars
and
a
week
-
end
pass
to
Davao
.

Trig
was
one
of
the
five
volunteers
.

The
patrol
snaked
around
in
back
of
the
cave
COMMA
approached
it
from
above
and
dropped
in
suddenly
with
wild
howls
.

You
could
hear
them
from
our
outpost
.

There
was
a
lot
of
shooting
.

We
knew
the
enemy
was
subdued
COMMA
because
a
flare
was
fired
as
the
signal
.

So
we
hurried
over
.

Two
of
our
men
were
killed
COMMA
a
third
was
wounded
.

Trig
and
a
very
black
colored
boy
from
Detroit
had
killed
or
put
out
of
action
ten
guerrillas
by
grenades
and
hand
-
to
-
hand
fighting
.

When
we
got
there
COMMA
Trig
and
the
Negro
were
quarreling
over
possession
of
a
gold
crucifix
around
the
neck
of
a
wounded
Filipino
.

The
colored
boy
had
it
COMMA
and
Trig
lunged
at
him
with
a
knife
and
said
COMMA
'
Give
that
to
me
COMMA
you
black
bastard
.

We
do
n't
'low
nigras
to
walk
on
the
same
sidewalk
with
white
men
where
I
come
from
.

``
The
Negro
got
a
bad
slice
on
his
chest
from
the
knife
wound
''
.

``
What
did
the
Colonel
do
about
the
men
''
?
Jane
asked
in
her
placid
COMMA
interested
way
.

Mickie
laughed
.

``
He
recommended
both
of
them
for
the
DSM
and
the
Detroit
fellow
for
the
Purple
Heart
COMMA
too
COMMA
for
a
combat
-
inflicted
wound
.

So
you
see
Mr.
Christiansen
knows
what
it
's
all
about
.

But
not
Jeff
Lawrence
.

When
he
was
in
the
war
COMMA
he
was
in
Law
or
Supplies
or
something
like
that
COMMA
and
an
old
buddy
of
his
told
me
he
would
come
down
on
Sundays
to
the
Pentagon
and
read
the
citations
for
medals
--
just
like
the
one
we
sent
in
for
Trig
--
and
go
away
with
a
real
glow
.

These
were
heroes
nine
feet
tall
to
him
''
.

Jefferson
Lawrence
was
alone
at
the
small
COMMA
perfectly
appointed
table
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
river
.

He
had
dinner
and
sat
there
over
his
coffee
watching
the
winding
pattern
of
traffic
as
it
crossed
the
bridge
and
spread
out
like
a
serpent
with
two
heads
.

Beside
him
was
Mrs.
Dalloway
.

He
thought
how
this
dainty
COMMA
fragile
older
woman
threading
her
way
through
the
streets
of
Westminster
on
a
day
in
June
COMMA
enjoying
the
flowers
in
the
shops
COMMA
the
greetings
from
old
friends
COMMA
but
never
really
drawing
a
deep
COMMA
passionate
breath
COMMA
was
so
like
himself
.

He
COMMA
and
Mrs.
Dalloway
COMMA
too
COMMA
had
never
permitted
themselves
the
luxury
of
joys
that
dug
into
the
bone
marrow
of
the
spirit
.

He
had
not
because
he
was
both
poor
and
ambitious
.

Poverty
imposes
a
kind
of
chastity
on
the
ambitious
.

They
can
not
stop
to
grasp
and
embrace
and
sit
in
the
back
seat
of
cars
along
a
dark
country
lane
.

No
COMMA
they
must
look
the
other
way
and
climb
one
more
painful
step
up
the
ladder
.

He
made
the
decision
with
his
eyes
open
COMMA
or
so
he
thought
.

At
any
cost
COMMA
he
must
leave
the
dreary
Pennsylvania
mining
town
where
his
father
was
a
pharmacist
.

And
so
he
had
COMMA
so
he
had
.

At
State
College
COMMA
he
had
no
time
to
walk
among
the
violets
on
the
water
's
edge
.

From
his
room
he
could
look
out
in
springtime
and
see
the
couples
hand
in
hand
walking
slowly
COMMA
deliciously
COMMA
across
the
campus
COMMA
and
he
could
smell
the
sweet
vernal
winds
.

He
was
not
stone
.

He
was
not
unmoved
.

He
had
to
teach
himself
patiently
that
these
traps
were
not
for
him
.

He
must
mentally
pull
the
blinds
and
close
the
window
COMMA
so
that
all
that
existed
was
in
the
books
before
him
.

At
law
school
COMMA
the
same
.

More
of
this
stamping
down
of
human
emotion
as
a
young
lawyer
in
New
York
.

By
the
time
he
was
prosperous
enough
--
his
goals
were
high
--
he
was
bald
and
afraid
of
women
.

The
only
one
who
would
have
him
was
his
cripple
COMMA
the
strange
unhappy
woman
who
became
his
wife
.

Perhaps
it
was
right
;
perhaps
it
was
just
.

He
had
dared
to
defy
nature
COMMA
to
turn
his
back
to
the
Lorelei
COMMA
and
he
was
punished
.

Like
Mrs.
Dalloway
COMMA
with
her
regrets
about
Peter
Walsh
COMMA
he
had
his
moments
of
melancholy
over
a
youth
too
well
spent
.

If
he
had
had
a
son
COMMA
he
would
tell
him
COMMA
``
Gather
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
This
same
flower
that
smiles
today
tomorrow
will
be
dying
''
.

But
then
his
son
could
afford
it
.

Lawrence
was
waiting
for
Bill
Boxell
.

The
Vice
President
had
called
and
asked
if
he
could
see
the
Secretary
at
his
home
.

He
said
the
matter
was
urgent
.

The
Secretary
was
uneasy
about
the
visit
.

He
did
not
like
Boxell
.

He
suspected
something
underhanded
and
furtive
about
him
.

Lawrence
could
not
put
his
finger
on
it
precisely
COMMA
and
this
worried
him
.

When
you
disliked
or
distrusted
a
man
COMMA
you
should
have
a
reason
.

Human
nature
was
not
a
piece
of
meat
you
could
tell
was
bad
by
its
smell
.

Lawrence
stared
a
minute
at
the
lighted
ribbon
of
traffic
COMMA
hoping
that
a
clue
to
his
dislike
of
the
Vice
President
would
appear
.

It
did
not
.

Therefore
COMMA
he
decided
he
was
unfair
to
the
young
man
and
should
make
an
effort
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
his
point
of
view
.

A
half
hour
later
the
Vice
President
arrived
.

He
looked
very
carefully
at
every
piece
of
furnishing
COMMA
as
though
hoping
to
store
this
information
carefully
in
his
mind
.

He
observed
the
Florentine
vase
in
the
hall
COMMA
the
Renoir
painting
in
the
library
COMMA
as
well
as
the
long
shelves
of
well
-
bound
volumes
;
the
pattern
of
the
Oriental
rug
COMMA
the
delicate
cut-glass
chandelier
.

He
said
to
the
Secretary
COMMA
``
I
understand
you
came
from
a
little
Pennsylvania
town
near
Wilkes-Barre
.

How
did
you
find
out
about
this
''
?

He
waved
his
arm
around
at
the
furnishings
.

It
was
not
a
discourteous
question
COMMA
Lawrence
decided
.

This
young
man
had
so
little
time
to
learn
he
had
to
be
curious
;
he
had
to
find
out
.

The
Secretary
did
not
tell
him
at
what
cost
COMMA
at
what
loneliness
COMMA
he
learned
these
things
.

He
merely
said
COMMA
``
Any
good
decorator
these
days
can
make
you
a
tasteful
home
''
.

The
Vice
President
said
COMMA
``
If
you
hear
of
any
names
that
would
fix
me
cheap
in
return
for
advertising
they
decorated
the
Vice
President
's
home
COMMA
let
me
know
.

I
can
do
business
with
that
kind
''
.

Again
COMMA
Lawrence
thought
a
little
sadly
COMMA
these
were
the
fees
of
poverty
and
ambition
.

Boxell
did
not
have
the
chance
to
grow
up
graciously
.

He
had
to
acquire
everything
he
was
going
to
get
in
four
years
.

They
had
brandy
in
the
library
.

Boxell
looked
at
Lawrence
with
a
searching
glance
COMMA
the
kind
that
a
prosecuting
attorney
would
give
a
man
on
trial
.

What
are
your
weaknesses
?

Where
will
you
break
?

How
best
to
destroy
your
peace
?

The
Vice
President
said
with
a
slight
bluster
COMMA
``
There
is
n't
anyone
who
loves
the
President
more
than
I
do
.

Old
Chris
is
my
ideal
.

At
the
same
time
COMMA
you
have
to
face
facts
and
realize
that
a
man
who
's
been
in
the
Marine
Corps
all
his
life
does
n't
understand
much
about
politics
.

What
does
a
monk
know
about
sex
''
?

Lawrence
listened
with
the
practiced
COMMA
deceptive
calm
of
the
lawyer
COMMA
but
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
.

``
So
COMMA
we
have
to
protect
the
old
man
for
his
own
good
.

You
see
what
I
mean
.

Congress
is
full
of
politicians
COMMA
and
if
you
want
to
get
along
with
them
COMMA
you
have
to
be
politic
.

This
is
why
I
say
we
just
ca
n't
go
ahead
and
disarm
the
Germans
and
pull
down
our
own
defenses
.

Let
me
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
today
.

A
fellow
came
up
to
me
COMMA
a
Senator
COMMA
I
do
n't
have
to
tell
you
his
name
COMMA
and
he
told
me
COMMA
'
I
love
the
President
like
a
brother
COMMA
but
God
damn
it
COMMA
he
's
crucifying
me
.

I
've
got
a
quarter
of
a
million
Germans
in
my
state
COMMA
and
those
krautheads
tune
in
on
Father
Werther
every
night
COMMA
and
if
he
tells
them
to
go
out
and
piss
in
the
public
square
COMMA
that
's
what
they
do
.

He
's
telling
them
now
to
write
letters
to
their
Congressmen
opposing
the
disarmament
of
Germany
.

And
another
one
comes
to
me
and
he
says
COMMA
'
Look
here
COMMA
there
's
a
mill
in
my
state
employs
five
thousand
people
making
uniforms
for
the
Navy
.

There
were
thirty-eight
patients
on
the
bus
the
morning
I
left
for
Hanover
COMMA
most
of
them
disturbed
and
hallucinating
.

An
interne
COMMA
a
nurse
and
two
attendants
were
in
charge
of
us
.

I
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
I
stared
out
the
bus
window
at
Chicago
's
grim
COMMA
dirty
West
Side
.

It
seemed
incredible
COMMA
as
I
listened
to
the
monotonous
drone
of
voices
and
smelled
the
fetid
odors
coming
from
the
patients
COMMA
that
technically
I
was
a
ward
of
the
state
of
Illinois
COMMA
going
to
a
hospital
for
the
mentally
ill
.

I
suddenly
thought
of
Mary
Jane
Brennan
COMMA
the
way
her
pretty
eyes
could
flash
with
anger
COMMA
her
quiet
competence
COMMA
the
gentleness
and
sweetness
that
lay
just
beneath
the
surface
of
her
defenses
.

We
had
become
good
friends
during
my
stay
at
Cook
County
Hospital
.

I
had
told
her
enough
about
myself
to
offset
somewhat
the
damaging
stories
that
had
appeared
in
local
newspapers
after
my
little
adventure
in
Marshall
Field
&
Co.
.

She
knew
that
I
lived
at
a
good
address
on
the
Gold
Coast
COMMA
that
I
had
once
been
a
medical
student
and
was
thinking
of
returning
to
the
university
to
finish
my
medical
studies
.

She
knew
also
that
I
was
unmarried
and
without
a
single
known
relative
.

She
was
n't
quite
sure
that
I
felt
enough
remorse
about
my
drinking
COMMA
or
that
I
would
not
return
to
it
once
I
was
out
and
on
my
own
again
.

This
had
worried
her
.

``
I
read
those
newspaper
stories
about
you
''
COMMA
she
had
said
.

``
You
must
have
loved
that
girl
very
much
COMMA
but
you
could
n't
have
meant
it
when
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
kill
her
''
.

``
Why
do
you
say
that
''
?
I
asked
.

``
I
was
full
of
booze
and
COMMA
well
COMMA
a
drunk
is
apt
to
do
anything
he
says
he
'll
do
''
.

Nonsense
!

I
grew
up
in
an
Irish
neighborhood
on
Chicago
's
West
Side
.

Do
n't
tell
me
about
drunks
.

You
're
not
the
kind
to
go
violent
.

Were
you
in
love
with
that
girl
''
?

``
Would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
I
were
COMMA
Mary
Jane
''
?

She
met
my
eyes
COMMA
suddenly
angry
.

``
I
would
n't
have
gone
into
nursing
if
I
did
n't
care
about
people
.

I
'm
interested
in
every
patient
I
've
helped
take
care
of
.

When
I
think
of
people
like
you
COMMA
well
COMMA
I
''
--

``
You
what
COMMA
Mary
Jane
''
?

``
You
are
young
COMMA
intelligent
COMMA
have
a
whole
lifetime
before
you
to
make
something
worth
while
of
yourself
COMMA
but
you
mess
it
up
with
whiskey
COMMA
indifference
COMMA
self
-
destructive
attitudes
.

I
do
n't
blame
that
girl
for
breaking
her
engagement
with
you
.

Was
she
pretty
''
?

``
Oh
COMMA
yes
''
COMMA
I
said
COMMA
feeling
annoyed
COMMA
``
she
was
very
pretty
.

You
do
n't
believe
that
I
'm
going
back
to
medical
school
and
finish
COMMA
do
you
''
?

``
Why
should
I
?

I
've
worked
this
ward
for
three
months
now
.

We
keep
getting
the
same
ones
back
again
and
again
.

They
all
mean
well
COMMA
have
great
promises
to
make
when
they
are
about
to
go
home
COMMA
but
drinking
is
their
sickness
.

You
've
not
seemed
like
them
COMMA
but
maybe
you
are
.

You
've
treated
your
stay
here
like
a
big
joke
.

It
's
not
a
joke
to
be
sent
to
a
place
like
this
or
to
Hanover
.

I
wanted
to
go
to
college
COMMA
too
''
--

``
Why
did
n't
you
''
?
I
asked
.

``
Chicago
has
some
of
the
best
''
--

Her
eyes
flashed
angrily
.

``
That
's
what
I
mean
about
you
COMMA
Anderson
''
COMMA
she
said
.

``
You
do
n't
seem
to
know
much
about
reality
.

I
'll
tell
you
why
I
did
n't
go
to
college
;
I
'm
the
oldest
of
six
children
.

My
father
's
a
policeman
and
makes
less
than
seven
thousand
dollars
a
year
.

There
was
no
money
for
tuition
COMMA
for
clothes
COMMA
for
all
the
things
you
apparently
take
for
granted
.

Nurses
'
training
here
does
n't
cost
anything
.

They
even
pay
me
six
dollars
a
month
.

I
think
it
's
a
good
deal
.

I
'm
going
to
become
a
good
nurse
COMMA
and
I
've
got
two
baby
brothers
that
are
going
to
have
college
if
I
have
to
work
at
my
profession
until
I
'm
an
old
maid
to
give
it
to
them
''
.

``
Do
you
have
a
boy
friend
''
?
I
asked
.

``
That
's
none
of
your
business
''
COMMA
she
said
COMMA
then
changed
the
subject
.

``
What
about
your
father
and
mother
COMMA
do
n't
you
think
of
them
when
you
're
in
a
place
like
this
''
?

``
My
father
and
mother
died
when
I
was
two
years
old
''
COMMA
I
said
.

``
My
aunt
raised
me
.

Aunt
Mary
died
when
I
was
doing
my
military
service
.

I
have
no
one
but
myself
to
worry
about
''
.

Something
in
my
voice
must
have
touched
her
deeply
because
her
anger
passed
quickly
COMMA
and
she
turned
away
to
keep
me
from
seeing
her
face
.

``
I
'm
sorry
''
COMMA
she
said
.

``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'd
do
without
my
family
.

We
've
always
been
so
close
''
.

``
Tell
me
more
about
them
''
.

Her
eyes
became
bright
as
she
talked
about
her
father
and
mother
COMMA
aunts
and
uncles
COMMA
cousins
.

Listening
COMMA
I
felt
cheated
and
lonely
as
only
an
orphan
can
.

When
she
had
finished
I
said
:
``
Your
dad
sounds
like
a
good
father
and
a
good
policeman
.

I
'll
bet
he
would
n't
be
pleased
if
a
rumdum
like
me
were
to
ask
his
daughter
for
a
date
--
I
mean
COMMA
after
I
'm
out
of
the
hospital
COMMA
a
month
or
so
from
now
''
.

``
My
father
is
a
sergeant
of
detectives
and
has
been
attached
to
Homicide
for
five
years
.

He
's
a
pretty
good
judge
of
character
COMMA
Anderson
.

I
do
n't
think
he
'd
mind
too
much
if
he
were
sure
you
'd
decided
not
to
be
a
rumdum
in
the
future
''
.

``
What
about
you
?

How
would
you
feel
about
it
if
I
were
to
ask
you
for
a
date
when
I
get
through
at
Hanover
''
?

``
If
I
thought
you
were
serious
about
going
back
to
school
COMMA
that
you
'd
learned
something
from
your
experiences
here
and
at
Hanover
--
well
COMMA
I
might
consider
such
an
offer
.

What
about
your
that
girl
you
were
going
to
kill
''
?

It
suddenly
seemed
very
important
to
me
that
Mary
Jane
Brennan
should
know
the
truth
about
me
--
that
I
was
not
the
confused
COMMA
sick
COMMA
irresponsible
person
she
believed
me
to
be
.

``
There
are
things
about
me
that
I
can
n't
tell
you
now
COMMA
Mary
Jane
''
COMMA
I
said
COMMA
``
but
if
you
'll
go
out
to
dinner
with
me
when
I
get
out
of
Hanover
COMMA
I
'd
like
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
.

I
can
say
this
:
I
'm
dead
serious
about
going
back
to
school
.

As
for
that
other
girl
COMMA
let
's
just
say
that
I
never
want
to
see
her
again
.

You
will
get
to
come
home
on
long
weekends
from
Hanover
COMMA
wo
n't
you
''
?

``
Yes
COMMA
I
'll
get
one
overnight
a
month
''
.

``
We
'll
go
up
to
the
Edgewater
Beach
Hotel
for
dinner
''
COMMA
I
said
.

``
Do
you
like
to
dance
?

They
always
have
a
good
orchestra
''
.

``
I
like
to
dance
''
COMMA
she
said
COMMA
then
turned
and
walked
away
.

There
had
n't
been
anything
really
personal
in
her
interest
in
me
.

I
knew
that
.

It
was
just
that
she
felt
deeply
about
every
patient
on
the
ward
and
wanted
to
believe
that
they
might
benefit
from
their
treatment
there
.

Now
COMMA
riding
this
hospital
bus
COMMA
feeling
isolated
and
utterly
alone
COMMA
I
knew
that
she
was
genuine
and
unique
COMMA
quite
unlike
any
girl
I
had
known
before
.

It
seemed
the
most
important
thing
in
my
life
at
this
moment
that
she
should
know
the
real
truth
about
me
.

It
was
a
fantastic
story
.

Only
two
people
in
the
state
of
Illinois
knew
that
I
was
entering
Hanover
State
Hospital
under
an
assumed
name
COMMA
or
why
.

It
was
unlikely
that
any
girl
as
sharp
as
Mary
Jane
Brennan
would
believe
it
without
proof
.

But
I
had
the
proof
COMMA
all
documented
in
a
legal
agreement
which
I
would
show
her
the
moment
I
was
free
to
do
so
.

As
the
bus
turned
into
the
main
highway
and
headed
toward
Hanover
I
settled
back
in
my
seat
and
closed
my
eyes
COMMA
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
past
two
weeks
COMMA
trying
to
put
the
pieces
in
order
.

I
wondered
suddenly
as
I
listened
to
the
disconnected
jabberings
coming
from
the
patient
behind
me
COMMA
if
I
had
not
perhaps
imagined
it
all
.

Perhaps
this
was
reality
and
Dale
Nelson
COMMA
the
actor
COMMA
was
delusion
;
a
figment
of
Carl
Anderson
's
imagination
.

Four

I
had
come
to
Chicago
from
New
York
early
in
September
with
a
dramatic
production
called
Ask
Tony
.

It
was
a
bad
play
COMMA
real
grade
-
A
turkey
COMMA
which
only
a
prevalence
of
angels
with
grandiose
dreams
of
capital
gain
and
tax
money
to
burn
could
have
put
into
rehearsal
.

No
one
COMMA
not
even
the
producer
COMMA
had
any
real
hope
of
getting
it
back
to
Broadway
.

But
because
it
was
a
suspense
gangster
story
of
the
Capone
era
COMMA
many
of
us
felt
that
it
might
catch
on
for
a
run
in
Chicago
COMMA
continue
as
a
road
company
COMMA
and
eventually
become
a
movie
.

Such
optimism
was
completely
unjustified
.

The
critics
literally
screamed
their
indignation
.

Ask
Tony
was
doomed
from
the
moment
Kupcinet
leveled
on
it
in
his
Sun-Times
column
.

We
opened
on
Friday
and
closed
the
following
Monday
.

Out
of
the
entire
cast
I
alone
received
good
notices
for
my
portrayal
of
a
psychopathic
killer
.

This
let
me
in
for
a
lot
of
kidding
from
the
rest
of
the
company
COMMA
two
members
of
which
were
native
Chicagoans
.

We
were
paid
off
Tuesday
morning
and
given
tickets
back
to
New
York
.

I
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
I
packed
my
bags
at
the
Croydon
Hotel
.

It
seemed
to
me
that
my
life
was
destined
to
be
one
brilliant
failure
after
another
.

I
had
been
among
the
top
third
in
my
class
at
N.Y.U.
COMMA
had
wanted
desperately
to
go
to
medical
school
COMMA
but
I
'd
run
out
of
money
and
energy
at
the
same
time
.

Then
later
I
had
quit
my
safe
COMMA
secure
five
-
a
-
week
spot
on
a
network
soap
opera
to
take
a
part
in
this
play
.

It
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
not
only
unlucky
but
quite
stupid
as
well
.

I
knew
that
I
'd
soon
be
back
working
as
an
orderly
at
the
hospital
or
as
a
counterman
at
Union
News
or
Schraffts
while
waiting
for
another
acting
job
to
open
.

It
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
I
did
not
particularly
like
acting
COMMA
that
I
was
at
some
sort
of
crossroads
and
would
have
to
decide
soon
what
I
was
going
to
do
with
my
life
.

I
closed
the
last
bag
and
stood
all
three
at
the
door
for
the
bellboy
to
pick
up
COMMA
then
went
to
the
bathroom
for
a
drink
of
water
.

The
telephone
rang
.

When
I
answered
it
a
voice
too
dignified
and
British
to
be
real
said
COMMA
``
Is
this
Mr.
Dale
Nelson
COMMA
the
actor
''
?

``
All
right
''
COMMA
I
said
.

``
Why
do
n't
you
bastards
lay
off
for
a
while
''
?

``
I
beg
your
pardon
COMMA
sir
''
?

``
All
right
.

This
is
Dale
Nelson
the
actor
''
.

``
Good
.

I
'm
calling
you
COMMA
Mr.
Nelson
COMMA
at
the
request
of
Mr.
Phillip
Wycoff
.

Could
you
possibly
have
lunch
with
him
today
?

His
car
could
pick
you
up
at
your
hotel
at
twelve
''
.

I
smiled
.

``
You
'll
send
the
Rolls-Royce
COMMA
of
course
''
?

``
Yes
COMMA
of
course
COMMA
Mr.
Nelson
''
.

I
started
to
say
something
else
appropriate
COMMA
but
the
man
had
hung
up
.

I
finally
went
downstairs
to
the
bar
off
the
main
lobby
where
most
of
the
cast
were
drowning
their
sorrows
over
the
untimely
passing
of
Ask
Tony
.

They
all
bowed
low
as
I
approached
them
.

``
All
right
COMMA
you
bastards
''
COMMA
I
said
COMMA
``
the
great
actor
is
about
to
buy
a
drink
''
.

I
laid
a
tenspot
on
the
bar
and
motioned
to
the
bartender
to
serve
a
round
.

He
had
just
returned
my
change
when
the
doorman
came
in
off
the
street
to
page
me
.

I
walked
over
to
him
.

``
You
Mr.
Nelson
''
?
He
asked
.

``
That
's
right
''
.

``
Mr.
Wycoff
's
car
is
waiting
for
you
at
the
east
entrance
''
.

I
followed
him
out
through
the
lobby
to
the
street
.

An
ancient
Rolls-Royce
COMMA
as
shiningly
impressive
as
the
day
it
came
off
the
ship
COMMA
was
parked
at
the
curb
.

The
elderly
chauffeur
COMMA
immaculate
in
a
dark
uniform
COMMA
stood
stiffly
at
attention
holding
open
the
door
of
the
town
car
.

I
was
giving
the
parked
cars
the
once-over
.

The
Oldsmobile
with
the
license
number
JYJ
114
was
in
stall
number
five
.

``
Okay
''
COMMA
I
said
to
the
attendant
COMMA
``
I
'll
let
you
know
if
I
close
the
deal
on
the
office
in
this
building
''
.

I
walked
with
him
back
to
the
entrance
.

He
gave
me
a
ticket
on
the
agency
car
and
parked
it
.

I
was
back
in
ten
minutes
.

``
Forgot
to
get
something
out
of
the
car
''
COMMA
I
told
him
COMMA
showing
him
my
ticket
.

He
started
to
say
something
as
I
walked
in
and
then
suddenly
grinned
and
said
COMMA
``
Oh
COMMA
yes
.

You
're
the
one
I
was
talking
to
about
a
monthly
rental
.

``
That
's
right
''
COMMA
I
told
him
.

He
consulted
the
parking
ticket
COMMA
then
looked
at
a
notation
and
said
COMMA
``
You
're
in
the
third
row
back
toward
the
rear
.

Can
you
find
it
all
right
''
?

``
Sure
''
COMMA
I
told
him
.

I
went
back
to
the
agency
car
and
got
out
an
electric
bug
COMMA
one
of
the
newest
devices
for
electronic
shadowing
.

I
always
keep
a
set
in
the
car
.

I
put
in
new
batteries
so
as
to
be
certain
I
'd
have
plenty
of
power
and
on
my
way
out
walked
over
to
the
regular
parking
stalls
and
stood
looking
at
them
thoughtfully
.

I
waited
until
the
parking
attendant
was
busy
with
a
customer
COMMA
then
slipped
around
the
back
of
the
car
with
license
number
JYM
114
COMMA
attached
the
electronic
bug
to
the
rear
bumper
and
walked
out
.

The
attendant
waved
me
on
.

One
of
the
hardest
chores
a
detective
has
is
hanging
around
on
a
city
street
COMMA
trying
to
make
himself
inconspicuous
COMMA
keeping
an
eye
on
the
entrance
of
an
office
building
and
waiting
.

For
the
first
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
it
's
possible
to
be
more
or
less
interested
in
window
displays
COMMA
then
in
people
passing
by
.

After
a
while
COMMA
however
COMMA
a
person
's
mind
gets
fed
up
and
that
magnifies
all
of
the
disagreeable
physical
symptoms
which
go
with
that
sort
of
an
assignment
.

You
want
to
sit
down
.

Your
leg
muscles
and
back
muscles
feel
weary
.

You
're
conscious
of
the
fact
that
your
feet
hurt
COMMA
that
the
city
pavements
are
hard
.

I
waited
a
solid
two
hours
before
my
man
came
out
of
the
office
building
.

He
came
out
alone
.

I
was
n't
far
behind
him
when
he
entered
the
parking
lot
and
hurried
over
to
his
car
.

The
attendant
recognized
me
once
more
and
said
COMMA
``
What
did
you
do
about
that
office
''
?

``
I
have
n't
made
up
my
mind
yet
''
COMMA
I
said
.

``
It
's
a
sublease
.

I
have
a
couple
of
them
I
'm
figuring
on
;
one
here
and
one
that
's
out
quite
a
ways
where
there
's
usually
curb
parking
''
.

``
That
curb
parking
is
undependable
and
annoying
COMMA
particularly
when
it
rains
''
COMMA
he
said
.

I
kept
trying
to
get
him
to
take
my
money
.

``
Okay
''
COMMA
I
told
him
.

``
I
'm
in
a
rush
right
now
.

I
know
where
the
car
is
.

Want
me
to
drive
it
out
''
?

``
I
'll
have
one
of
the
boys
get
it
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
It
's
one
of
the
rules
on
transients
.

Regulars
drive
out
their
own
cars
''
.

``
Make
it
as
snappy
as
you
can
COMMA
will
you
''
?
I
asked
.

``
Oh
COMMA
that
's
all
right
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
You
're
going
to
be
a
regular
.

You
'll
get
in
the
office
building
here
.

You
do
n't
want
to
lease
a
place
way
out
in
the
sticks
.

You
get
business
where
the
business
is
COMMA
not
where
it
is
n't
''
.

I
grinned
at
him
COMMA
handed
him
a
couple
of
dollars
and
said
COMMA
``
By
the
time
you
get
the
parking
charge
figured
up
COMMA
there
should
be
a
cigar
in
it
for
you
''
.

I
hurried
over
to
the
agency
heap
COMMA
jumped
in
COMMA
started
the
motor
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
car
I
wanted
to
shadow
turn
to
the
left
.

I
was
held
up
a
bit
trying
to
make
a
left
turn
.

By
the
time
I
'd
made
it
he
was
gone
.

Traffic
was
pretty
heavy
.

I
turned
on
the
electric
bug
COMMA
and
the
signal
came
in
loud
and
clear
.

I
made
time
and
picked
him
up
within
ten
blocks
.

I
stayed
half
a
block
behind
him
COMMA
letting
lots
of
cars
keep
in
between
us
COMMA
listening
to
the
steady
beep
beep
beep
.

After
fifteen
minutes
of
traffic
driving
he
turned
to
the
left
.

I
could
n't
see
him
COMMA
but
the
electric
bugging
device
gave
steady
beeps
when
it
was
straight
ahead
COMMA
short
half
beeps
when
the
car
I
was
following
was
to
the
left
COMMA
and
long
drawn-out
beeps
when
it
turned
to
the
right
.

If
it
ever
got
behind
me
COMMA
the
beep
turned
to
a
buzz
.

I
turned
left
too
soon
and
got
a
signal
showing
that
I
was
still
behind
him
but
he
was
to
the
right
.

After
a
while
the
signal
became
a
buzz
and
I
knew
he
was
behind
me
.

That
meant
he
'd
parked
someplace
.

I
made
a
big
circle
until
I
located
the
car
parked
at
the
curb
in
front
of
an
apartment
house
.

I
found
a
parking
place
half
a
block
away
COMMA
sat
in
the
car
and
waited
.

My
quarry
was
in
the
apartment
house
for
two
hours
.

Then
he
came
out
and
started
driving
toward
the
beach
.

By
this
time
it
was
dark
.

I
could
get
up
close
to
him
where
there
was
traffic
but
had
to
drop
far
behind
when
there
was
n't
traffic
.

My
lights
would
have
been
a
giveaway
if
I
'd
tried
to
shadow
him
in
the
conventional
manner
.

Moreover
COMMA
I
'd
have
lost
him
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
electronic
shadowing
device
.

His
signal
was
coming
loud
and
clear
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
turned
to
a
buzz
.

I
circled
the
block
and
found
he
was
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
high-class
restaurant
.

I
sat
where
I
could
watch
the
exit
and
realized
I
was
hungry
.

I
sat
there
with
the
faint
odor
of
charcoal
-
broiled
steaks
tantalizing
my
nostrils
and
occasionally
catching
the
aroma
of
coffee
.

My
man
came
out
an
hour
later
COMMA
drove
to
the
beach
COMMA
turned
right
and
after
half
a
mile
went
to
the
Swim
and
Tan
Motel
.

It
was
a
fairly
modern
motel
with
quite
a
bit
of
electrical
display
in
front
.

I
remembered
it
was
the
Peeping
Tom
place
.

I
waited
until
my
man
was
coming
out
of
the
office
with
the
key
to
a
cabin
before
I
went
in
to
register
.

The
card
the
man
I
was
shadowing
had
filled
out
was
still
on
the
counter
.

I
noticed
that
he
was
in
Unit
12
and
that
he
had
registered
under
the
name
of
Oscar
L.
Palmer
and
wife
COMMA
giving
a
San
Francisco
address
.

He
had
written
out
the
license
number
of
his
car
but
had
transposed
the
last
two
figures
COMMA
an
old
dodge
which
is
still
good
.

Ninety-nine
times
out
of
a
hundred
the
motel
manager
does
n't
check
the
license
number
on
the
plates
against
the
license
number
the
tenant
writes
out
.

If
he
does
COMMA
it
's
still
better
than
an
even
chance
he
wo
n't
notice
the
transposition
of
the
numbers
COMMA
and
if
he
should
notice
it
COMMA
the
thing
can
be
passed
off
as
an
honest
mistake
.

I
used
the
alias
of
Robert
C.
Richards
COMMA
gave
the
first
three
letters
and
the
first
and
last
figure
of
the
license
number
on
the
agency
heap
COMMA
but
a
couple
of
phony
numbers
in
between
.

I
could
have
written
anything
.

The
manager
of
the
motel
was
a
woman
who
apparently
did
n't
care
.

She
was
complying
with
the
law
in
regard
to
registrations
but
she
certainly
was
n't
checking
license
numbers
or
bothering
the
tenants
.

``
You
mean
you
're
all
alone
COMMA
Mr.
Richards
''
?

``
That
's
right
''
.

``
Your
wife
is
n't
going
to
join
you
--
later
''
?

``
I
do
n't
think
so
''
.

``
If
you
expect
her
to
show
up
''
COMMA
she
said
COMMA
``
you
'd
better
put
'
and
wife
'
on
there
.

It
's
a
formality
COMMA
you
know
''
.

``
Any
difference
in
the
rate
''
?
I
asked
.

``
Not
to
you
''
COMMA
she
said
smiling
.

``
It
's
ten
dollars
either
way
.

There
are
ice
cubes
in
a
container
at
the
far
end
and
in
another
by
the
office
.

There
are
three
soft-drink
vending
machines
COMMA
and
if
you
should
be
joined
by
--
anybody
--
try
to
keep
things
quiet
COMMA
if
you
will
.

We
like
to
run
a
nice
quiet
place
''
.

``
Thank
you
''
COMMA
I
told
her
.

I
took
another
sidelong
glance
at
the
other
registration
card
COMMA
then
took
the
key
to
Unit
13
that
she
had
given
me
and
went
down
long
enough
to
park
the
car
.

The
construction
was
reasonably
solid
;
not
like
the
cracker
-
box
construction
of
so
many
of
the
motel
units
that
have
stucco
all
over
the
outside
but
walls
that
are
thin
enough
so
you
can
hear
every
movement
of
the
people
in
the
adjoining
apartment
.

I
put
a
small
electric
amplifier
against
the
wall
on
the
side
I
wanted
to
case
.

With
the
aid
of
that
I
could
hear
my
man
moving
around
COMMA
heard
him
cough
a
couple
of
times
COMMA
heard
the
toilet
flush
COMMA
heard
the
sound
of
water
running
.

Whoever
his
companion
was
going
to
be
COMMA
she
was
going
to
join
him
later
.

She
knew
where
to
come
.

He
did
n't
have
to
telephone
.

I
was
so
hungry
my
stomach
felt
all
lines
of
communication
had
been
severed
.

It
's
one
thing
to
go
without
food
when
you
're
occupied
with
some
work
or
when
you
're
simply
postponing
a
meal
COMMA
but
when
you
're
dependent
on
someone
else
and
know
that
you
ca
n't
eat
until
he
's
bedded
down
for
the
night
COMMA
hunger
can
be
a
gnawing
torture
.

I
had
noticed
a
drive-in
down
the
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.

The
batteries
on
the
bugging
device
I
had
put
on
the
car
were
still
fresh
enough
to
send
out
good
strong
signals
.

The
powerful
microphone
I
could
press
against
the
wall
between
my
motel
unit
and
that
occupied
by
the
man
would
bring
in
the
sound
of
any
conversation
COMMA
and
I
was
positively
nauseated
I
was
so
hungry
.

I
got
in
the
car
COMMA
drove
down
to
the
drive-in
and
ordered
a
couple
of
hamburgers
with
everything
included
COMMA
a
cup
of
coffee
and
the
fastest
service
possible
.

The
place
was
n't
particularly
busy
at
that
time
of
night
COMMA
and
the
girl
who
was
waiting
on
me
COMMA
who
was
clothed
in
the
tightest
-
fitting
pair
of
slacks
I
had
ever
seen
on
a
woman
and
a
sweater
that
showed
everything
there
was
--
and
there
was
lots
of
it
--
wanted
to
be
sociable
.

``
You
really
in
a
hurry
COMMA
Handsome
''
?
She
asked
.

``
I
'm
in
a
hurry
COMMA
Beautiful
''
.

``
It
's
early
in
the
evening
to
be
in
a
hurry
.

There
's
lots
of
time
left
''
.

``
There
may
not
be
any
women
left
''
COMMA
I
said
.

She
gave
a
little
pout
and
said
COMMA
``
I
do
n't
get
off
work
until
eleven
o'clock
.

That
's
when
my
evening
commences
''
.

``
I
'll
be
here
at
ten-fifty-five
''
COMMA
I
said
.

``
Oh
COMMA
you
!
''
She
announced
.

``
That
's
what
they
all
say
.

What
's
that
thing
going
buzz-buzz-buzz
in
your
car
''
?

I
said
``
Darn
it
COMMA
that
's
the
automatic
signal
that
shows
when
the
ignition
key
is
on
.

I
did
n't
turn
it
off
''
.

I
reached
over
and
switched
off
the
electronic
bugging
device
.

She
went
in
to
get
the
hamburgers
COMMA
and
I
switched
on
the
device
again
and
kept
the
signal
from
Dowling
's
car
coming
in
steady
and
clear
until
I
saw
her
starting
back
with
the
hamburgers
.

Then
I
shut
off
the
device
again
.

She
wanted
to
hang
around
while
I
was
eating
.

``
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
selfish
to
have
dinner
before
you
go
to
pick
her
up
''
?

``
No
''
COMMA
I
said
.

``
It
's
a
kindness
to
her
.

You
see
COMMA
she
's
on
a
diet
.

She
'll
eat
just
a
pineapple
and
cottage
cheese
salad
and
I
'm
to
have
one
with
her
so
she
wo
n't
feel
out
of
place
''
.

``
Diets
can
be
terrible
''
COMMA
the
girl
said
.

``
How
much
overweight
is
she
''
?

``
Not
a
bit
''
COMMA
I
said
COMMA
``
but
she
's
keeping
her
figure
in
hand
''
.

She
looked
at
me
provocatively
.

``
Good
figures
should
be
kept
in
hand
''
COMMA
she
said
COMMA
and
walked
away
with
an
exaggerated
wiggle
.

I
turned
on
the
device
again
COMMA
half
fearful
that
I
might
find
silence
COMMA
but
the
buzzes
came
in
loud
and
clear
.

When
I
switched
on
the
lights
for
her
to
come
and
get
the
check
COMMA
I
had
the
exact
change
plus
a
dollar
tip
.

The
fat
man
said
COMMA
``
All
we
gotta
do
is
go
around
the
corner
''
.

The
gun
moved
.

The
thin
man
said
COMMA
``
That-a-way
''
.

``
--
second
building
on
the
right
''
.

``
--
it
says
police
right
on
the
door
''
.

``
--
so
even
if
we
was
as
dumb
as
you
take
us
for
COMMA
we
could
still
find
it
''
.

Roberta
and
Dave
began
to
back
toward
the
door
.

The
thin
man
waved
the
gun
again
.

He
said
COMMA
``
Right
around
the
corner
''
.

``
It
says
water
works
COMMA
but
there
is
a
policeman
on
duty
COMMA
too
''
.

``
A
night
policeman
just
like
in
the
States
.

You
know
''
?

``
Canada
does
n't
have
much
of
this
here
juvenile
delinquency
problem
COMMA
but
we
keep
a
night
policeman
all
the
same
on
account
of
the
crazy
tourists
''
.

At
the
door
COMMA
Dave
paused
to
feel
for
the
latch
.

Roberta
glanced
up
at
her
husband
.

He
was
going
to
be
sensible
and
not
try
to
do
anything
rash
with
that
gun
pointed
at
him
.

She
measured
the
distance
from
where
they
stood
to
the
men
and
the
gun
COMMA
measured
the
distance
from
the
men
to
the
back
room
.

She
decided
to
risk
it
.

There
was
something
phony
about
all
this
gun
waving
--
something
not
quite
what
it
seemed
in
the
detailed
directions
for
finding
the
police
.

Dave
had
the
latch
under
his
thumb
now
and
he
removed
his
arm
from
his
wife
in
order
to
pull
the
door
open
.

In
a
flash
she
was
away
to
the
back
COMMA
paying
no
attention
to
three
angry
shouts
from
the
male
throats
.

She
tore
open
the
back
door
.

It
was
dark
inside
the
room
but
enough
light
spilled
from
the
restaurant
behind
her
to
enable
her
to
make
out
a
round
table
with
a
green
cloth
top
.

There
was
a
small
sideboard
with
some
empty
beer
bottles
on
it
and
perhaps
fifteen
wooden
chairs
.

Slowly
she
turned
to
face
the
men
again
.

Rat
-
face
at
the
counter
was
on
his
feet
.

The
distance
between
where
she
stood
and
where
Dave
waited
at
the
outside
door
was
a
hundred
miles
.

Keeping
her
frightened
gaze
on
the
men
at
the
counter
COMMA
she
began
to
feel
her
way
to
the
door
.

She
sidled
along
the
booths
one
step
at
a
time
.

The
gun
followed
her
.

As
she
reached
Dave
and
felt
his
arm
go
around
her
COMMA
felt
him
pull
her
to
the
safety
of
his
person
COMMA
she
knew
with
the
certainty
of
despair
that
something
bad
had
happened
to
Lauren
.

The
two
men
watched
as
Dave
closed
the
door
behind
them
COMMA
watched
them
cross
the
sidewalk
to
their
car
.

It
was
getting
light
.

The
fat
man
removed
his
apron
COMMA
put
on
a
greasy
and
wrinkled
jacket
COMMA
and
zipped
it
over
his
paunch
.

The
thin
man
moved
swiftly
to
the
phone
and
dialed
a
number
.

When
he
was
answered
COMMA
he
said
COMMA
``
Albert
?

Vince
.

I
'm
sending
you
a
couple
of
customers
--
yeah
--
just
get
them
out
of
my
hair
and
keep
them
out
--
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
what
you
tell
them
--
only
do
n't
believe
a
word
they
say
--
they
're
out
to
make
trouble
for
me
and
it
is
up
to
you
to
stop
them
--
I
do
n't
care
how
--
and
one
more
thing
--
Cate
's
Cafe
closed
at
eleven
like
always
last
night
and
Rose
and
Clarence
Corsi
left
for
Quebec
yesterday
--
some
shrine
or
other
--
I
think
it
was
called
Saint
Simon
's
--
yeah
COMMA
yesterday
.

Got
it
''
?

He
turned
from
the
phone
and
strode
to
the
front
of
the
restaurant
.

The
white
Buick
had
n't
moved
away
yet
.

Good
.

A
line
of
worry
formed
COMMA
a
twitch
pulled
his
mouth
over
to
one
side
.

He
said
COMMA
``
Grosse
?

You
ai
n't
kidding
me
--
the
kid
do
n't
know
the
name
of
this
town
''
?

``
I
ai
n't
kidding
you
COMMA
Vince
.

How
could
she
?

She
musta
been
walking
in
her
sleep
--
you
seen
her
yourself
in
here
''
.

``
Howda
I
know
''
?

``
Remember
how
she
looked
when
Barney
held
the
door
for
her
?

Kinda
like
a
zombie
?

She
was
just
waking
up
when
we
found
her
at
the
garage
''
.

Vince
swore
.

``
Stupid
fools
--
ai
n't
got
enough
brains
between
the
two
of
you
''
--
Grosse
muttered
COMMA
his
head
down
COMMA
one
hand
playing
with
the
zipper
on
his
jacket
.

``
--
had
enough
brains
to
call
ya
up
so
as
ya
could
do
sompin
about
it
when
the
parents
--
I
could
a
let
her
go
go
''
--
His
eyes
were
lowered
COMMA
so
he
could
n't
have
seen
the
narrow
COMMA
pointed
face
of
his
companion
suddenly
writhe
with
fury
;
but
he
was
aware
of
it
just
the
same
.

He
knew
Vince
Steiner
was
one
of
those
men
who
had
to
work
up
a
fury
once
in
a
while
just
to
prove
how
dangerous
he
could
be
.

With
a
curse
COMMA
Vince
seized
the
thing
nearest
COMMA
a
glass
sugar
container
with
a
spouted
metal
top
COMMA
and
threw
it
against
the
wall
opposite
.

The
heavy
glass
did
n't
break
COMMA
but
the
top
flew
off
;
sugar
sprayed
with
a
hiss
that
was
loud
in
the
silence
.

Not
really
startled
COMMA
but
careful
to
appear
so
COMMA
Grosse
sucked
noisily
on
his
pipe
.

Vince
cursed
steadily
.

``
Why
does
everything
have
to
happen
to
me
''
?

Grosse
quietly
got
a
broom
and
started
to
sweep
up
the
sugar
.

Vince
watched
him
.

His
mouth
worked
over
the
profanity
COMMA
the
obscenities
in
his
vocabulary
.

Once
he
said
COMMA
``
Why
'n
hell
did
n't
you
look
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car
before
you
drove
off
?

Do
n't
you
and
Barney
ever
use
your
brains
''
?

The
fat
man
did
n't
answer
.

He
got
one
of
the
menus
and
brushed
the
spilled
sugar
onto
it
and
carried
it
to
a
box
on
the
floor
behind
the
counter
.

He
returned
the
menu
to
its
place
between
catchup
bottle
and
paper
napkin
dispenser
.

He
spoke
soothingly
.

``
She
do
n't
know
nothing
about
them
cars
.

She
thinks
she
's
in
a
ordinary
garage
''
.

``
How
do
you
know
COMMA
stupid
?

And
put
Cate
's
gun
back
''
.

``
I
know
''
.

Grosse
tucked
the
gun
under
the
counter
.

``
--
one
word
of
this
gets
to
Guardino
''
--

``
Who
's
telling
Guardino
''
?

Vince
swore
again
.

``
You
get
that
kid
over
to
Rose
's
house
''
.

The
fat
man
winced
.

He
ran
a
finger
down
his
cheek
COMMA
tracing
the
scratch
there
.

``
Why
ca
n't
I
leave
her
locked
up
in
the
tool
crib
''
?

The
thin
man
stopped
his
pacing
long
enough
to
glance
at
the
clock
.

``
You
and
Barney
get
her
over
to
Rose
's
before
it
gets
too
light
.

After
Guardino
's
left
COMMA
we
'll
dump
the
kid
somewhere
near
the
border
where
she
kin
get
home
.

God
help
you
if
she
knows
where
she
's
been
''
.

Grosse
spread
his
hands
.

``
What
am
I
going
to
do
with
her
all
day
?

In
the
tool
crib
she
ca
n't
get
away
''
.

``
What
the
hell
do
I
care
what
you
do
with
her
all
day
?

Just
get
her
where
Guardino
wo
n't
see
her
and
start
asking
questions
''
.

Grosse
swore
now
.

``
Dammit
all
COMMA
Vince
.

I
ai
n't
no
baby
sitter
''
.

Vince
shouted
finally
COMMA
``
Get
her
over
to
Rose
's
and
I
'll
come
by
and
see
that
she
stays
put
''
.

Grosse
rubbed
the
bridge
of
his
nose
where
it
was
swollen
.

He
spoke
sullenly
.

``
You
do
n't
haf
ta
get
nasty
.

I
wish
you
luck
when
you
try
scaring
that
kid
''
.

Suddenly
he
grinned
.

His
voice
lost
its
sullen
tones
and
he
chuckled
.

``
I
got
one
question
''
.

``
What
is
it
''
?

Impatiently
.

``
Are
you
a
poor
dumb
Canadian
or
a
smart
aleck
from
the
States
''
?

Vince
lifted
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
COMMA
but
his
thin
lips
spread
in
a
smile
.

Grosse
ducked
and
sniggered
.

``
Where
'd
you
say
you
was
born
''
?

``
In
a
Chicago
slum
just
like
you
.

And
I
ai
n't
going
back
there
on
account
of
one
lousy
kid
''
.

Lauren
Landis
rubbed
her
face
against
the
blanket
.

She
had
cried
a
little
because
she
was
frightened
.

She
could
easily
understand
why
the
two
men
had
been
startled
to
find
a
strange
girl
in
the
back
seat
of
their
car
(
she
had
figured
that
out
)
COMMA
but
she
could
n't
understand
their
subsequent
actions
.

Was
it
because
she
had
shown
panic
?

Who
could
blame
her
for
that
?

It
was
one
thing
to
awaken
outside
a
restaurant
where
your
parents
were
eating
and
quite
another
to
awaken
in
a
strange
garage
and
know
your
parents
had
gone
on
home
without
you
.

She
was
glad
the
fat
man
had
left
.

Barney
was
not
really
frightening
.

She
jumped
as
the
little
man
now
appeared
at
the
window
and
COMMA
reaching
through
the
opening
COMMA
offered
her
a
bottle
of
coke
.

She
smiled
at
him
wetly
.

Although
she
found
she
was
thirsty
COMMA
she
was
about
to
refuse
(
never
COMMA
never
take
candy
from
a
strange
man
)
when
she
saw
the
bottle
was
unopened
.

He
placed
a
bottle
opener
on
the
counter
.

So
COMMA
he
understood
her
panic
.

She
blew
her
nose
on
a
tissue
and
opened
the
coke
bottle
.

It
was
icy
cold
and
tasted
delicious
.

She
felt
a
lift
in
spirit
.

When
she
was
finished
she
pushed
it
back
.

The
man
was
busy
doing
something
to
the
inside
of
the
door
-
frame
on
the
driver
's
side
of
a
car
.

She
called
softly
COMMA
``
Barney
''
.

He
looked
in
her
direction
but
he
did
n't
answer
.

She
said
COMMA
``
Barney
COMMA
why
is
he
keeping
me
here
''
?

Still
no
answer
.

He
seemed
to
be
looking
at
a
point
above
the
little
window
.

Lauren
said
COMMA
``
Why
ca
n't
I
call
my
home
?

Or
borrow
some
money
from
someone
and
go
home
by
bus
?

I
could
send
the
money
right
back
''
.

Barney
finished
the
cigarette
he
had
been
smoking
.

He
dropped
it
and
carefully
ground
it
to
nothing
with
the
sole
of
his
heavy
shoe
.

Now
he
looked
at
her
.

He
said
COMMA
``
I
only
work
here
''
.

Lauren
said
COMMA
``
Please
''
?

But
he
was
back
at
work
on
a
car
.

She
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
on
the
counter
.

How
could
he
be
kind
one
moment
and
cruel
the
next
?

Did
he
know
something
that
made
him
feel
sad
and
sorry
for
her
?

And
was
he
afraid
to
do
anything
as
definite
as
releasing
her
?

Her
heart
was
thumping
painfully
;
the
unknown
was
so
much
worse
than
--
what
dangers
lay
ahead
for
her
?

What
awful
thing
had
she
to
face
in
the
next
few
hours
?

Something
wet
and
hot
was
trickling
on
her
wrists
.

Tears
?

With
a
sturdy
act
of
will
she
turned
her
mind
away
from
herself
;
as
long
as
she
could
do
nothing
constructive
about
the
situation
she
was
in
COMMA
she
would
think
about
something
else
.

Her
mother
and
father
COMMA
for
instance
.

Where
were
they
now
?

In
her
mind
she
followed
the
white
Buick
along
the
road
somewhere
between
here
and
the
Niagara
River
.

Her
father
's
attention
would
be
on
the
road
ahead
and
it
would
n't
deviate
an
inch
until
he
crossed
the
bridge
at
the
Falls
and
took
the
River
Road
to
LaSalle
and
COMMA
finally
COMMA
turned
in
at
their
own
driveway
at
387
Heather
Heights
.

Then
he
would
yawn
and
stretch
and
shout
COMMA
``
All
out
.

This
is
the
end
of
the
line
''
.

And
what
would
her
mother
be
doing
right
now
?

Her
mother
would
be
fast
asleep
curled
up
against
that
wonderful
COMMA
big
COMMA
safe
COMMA
solid
shoulder
next
to
her
on
the
front
seat
.

Lauren
Landis
was
in
trouble
and
she
was
alone
.

Roberta
Landis
put
her
hand
on
her
husband
's
arm
as
he
slid
in
the
driver
's
seat
beside
her
.

Somewhere
birds
were
sweetly
calling
COMMA
were
answered
.

Her
teeth
chattered
so
that
she
made
three
attempts
at
speech
before
she
became
intelligible
.

``
Dave
.

I
saw
that
woman
's
apron
behind
the
door
.

There
was
a
wet
spot
--
she
could
n't
have
been
gone
long
''
.

Dave
made
some
sound
meant
to
convey
agreement
.

He
inserted
the
car
key
in
the
lock
.

Roberta
was
violently
trembling
.

She
stammered
COMMA
``
You
heard
what
he
said
about
police
?

Why
do
n't
we
drive
around
the
corner
''
?

The
car
door
crashed
shut
.

The
engine
throbbed
into
life
.

Dave
said
COMMA
``
I
got
the
message
.

We
're
going
''
.

Roberta
said
COMMA
``
no
.

You
go
.

Walk
.

Suppose
Lauren
comes
looking
for
us
?

I
can
sit
here
in
the
car
while
you
walk
around
the
corner
''
.

The
big
car
sprang
away
from
the
curb
like
something
alive
.

He
said
COMMA
``
I
'm
not
going
to
leave
my
wife
and
my
car
out
here
in
sight
of
those
''
--
Roberta
glanced
at
him
and
stopped
trembling
.

Ryan
hefted
his
bulk
up
and
supported
it
on
one
elbow
.

He
rubbed
his
eyes
sleepily
with
one
huge
paw
.

``
Ekstrohm
COMMA
Nogol
COMMA
you
guys
okay
''
?

``
Nothing
wrong
with
me
that
could
n't
be
cured
''
COMMA
Nogol
said
.

He
did
n't
say
what
would
cure
him
;
he
had
been
explaining
all
during
the
trip
what
he
needed
to
make
him
feel
like
himself
.

His
small
black
eyes
darted
inside
the
olive
oval
of
his
face
.

``
Ekstrohm
''
?
Ryan
insisted
.

``
Okay
''
.

``
Well
COMMA
let
's
take
a
ground
-
level
look
at
the
country
around
here
''
.

The
facsiport
rolled
open
on
the
landscape
.

A
range
of
bluffs
hugged
the
horizon
COMMA
the
color
of
decaying
moss
.

Above
them
COMMA
the
sky
was
the
black
of
space
COMMA
or
the
almost
equal
black
of
the
winter
sky
above
Minneapolis
COMMA
seen
against
neon
-
lit
snow
.

That
cold
COMMA
empty
sky
was
full
of
fire
and
light
.

It
seemed
almost
a
magnification
of
the
Galaxy
itself
COMMA
of
the
Milky
Way
COMMA
blown
up
by
some
master
photographer
.

This
fiery
swath
was
actually
only
a
belt
of
minor
planets
COMMA
almost
like
the
asteroid
belt
in
the
original
Solar
System
.

These
planets
were
much
bigger
COMMA
nearly
all
capable
of
holding
an
atmosphere
.

But
to
the
infuriation
of
scientists
COMMA
for
no
known
reason
not
all
of
them
did
.

This
would
be
the
fifth
mapping
expedition
to
the
planetoids
of
Yancy-6
in
three
generations
.

They
lay
months
away
from
the
nearest
Earth
star
by
jump
drive
COMMA
and
no
one
knew
what
they
were
good
for
COMMA
although
it
was
felt
that
they
would
probably
be
good
for
something
if
it
could
only
be
discovered
--
much
like
the
continent
of
Antarctica
in
ancient
history
.

``
How
can
a
planet
with
so
many
neighbors
be
so
lonely
''
?
Ryan
asked
.

He
was
the
captain
COMMA
so
he
could
ask
questions
like
that
.

``
Some
can
be
lonely
in
a
crowd
''
COMMA
Nogol
said
elaborately
.

``
What
will
we
need
outside
COMMA
Ryan
''
?
Ekstrohm
asked
.

``
No
helmets
''
COMMA
the
captain
answered
.

``
We
can
breathe
out
there
COMMA
all
right
.

It
just
wo
n't
be
easy
.

This
old
world
lost
all
of
its
helium
and
trace
gases
long
ago
.

Nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
about
it
''
.

``
Ryan
COMMA
look
over
there
''
COMMA
Nogol
said
.

``
Animals
.

Ringing
the
ship
.

Think
they
're
intelligent
COMMA
maybe
hostile
''
?

``
I
think
they
're
dead
''
COMMA
Ekstrohm
interjected
quietly
.

``
I
get
no
readings
from
them
at
all
.

Sonic
COMMA
electronic
COMMA
galvanic
--
all
blank
.

According
to
these
needles
COMMA
they
're
stone
dead
''
.

``
Ekstrohm
COMMA
you
and
I
will
have
a
look
''
COMMA
Ryan
said
.

``
You
hold
down
the
fort
COMMA
Nogol
.

Take
it
easy
''
.

``
Easy
''
COMMA
Nogol
confirmed
.

``
I
heard
a
story
once
about
a
rookie
who
got
excited
when
the
captain
stepped
outside
and
he
could
n't
get
an
encephalographic
reading
on
him
.

Me
COMMA
I
know
the
mind
of
an
officer
works
in
a
strange
and
unfathomable
manner
''
.

``
I
'm
not
worried
about
you
mis-reading
the
dials
COMMA
Nogol
COMMA
just
about
a
lug
like
you
reading
them
at
all
.

Remember
COMMA
when
the
little
hand
is
straight
up
that
's
negative
.

Positive
results
start
when
it
goes
towards
the
hand
you
use
to
make
your
mark
''
.

``
But
I
'm
ambidextrous
''
.

Ryan
told
him
what
he
could
do
then
.

Ekstrohm
smiled
COMMA
and
followed
the
captain
through
the
airlock
with
only
a
glance
at
the
lapel
gauge
on
his
coverall
.

The
strong
negative
field
his
suit
set
up
would
help
to
repel
bacteria
and
insects
.

Actually
COMMA
the
types
of
infection
that
could
attack
a
warm-blooded
mammal
were
not
infinite
COMMA
and
over
the
course
of
the
last
few
hundred
years
adequate
defenses
had
been
found
for
all
basic
categories
.

He
was
n't
likely
to
come
down
with
hot
chills
and
puzzling
striped
fever
.

They
ignored
the
ladder
down
to
the
planet
surface
and
COMMA
with
only
a
glance
at
the
seismological
gauge
to
judge
surface
resistance
COMMA
dropped
to
the
ground
.

It
was
day
COMMA
but
in
the
thin
atmosphere
contrasts
were
sharp
between
light
and
shadow
.

They
walked
from
midnight
to
noon
COMMA
noon
to
midnight
COMMA
and
came
to
the
beast
sprawled
on
its
side
.

Ekstrohm
nudged
it
with
a
boot
.

``
Hey
COMMA
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
wart-hog
''
.

``
Uh-huh
''
COMMA
Ryan
admitted
.

``
One
of
the
best
matches
I
've
ever
found
.

Well
COMMA
it
has
to
happen
.

Statistical
average
and
all
.

Still
COMMA
it
sometimes
gives
you
a
creepy
feeling
to
find
a
rabbit
or
a
snapping
turtle
on
some
strange
world
.

It
makes
you
wonder
if
this
exploration
business
is
n't
all
some
big
joke
COMMA
and
somebody
has
been
everywhere
before
you
even
started
''
.

The
surveyor
looked
sidewise
at
the
captain
.

The
big
man
seldom
gave
out
with
such
thoughts
.

Ekstrohm
cleared
his
throat
.

``
What
shall
we
do
with
this
one
?

Dissect
it
''
?

Ryan
nudged
it
with
his
toe
COMMA
following
Ekstrohm
's
example
.

``
I
do
n't
know
COMMA
Stormy
.

It
sure
as
hell
does
n't
look
like
any
dominant
intelligent
species
to
me
.

No
hands
COMMA
for
one
thing
.

Of
course
COMMA
that
's
not
definite
proof
''
.

``
No
COMMA
it
is
n't
''
COMMA
Ekstrohm
said
.

``
I
think
we
'd
better
let
it
lay
until
we
get
a
clearer
picture
of
the
ecological
setup
around
here
.

In
the
meantime
COMMA
we
might
be
thinking
on
the
problem
all
these
dead
beasts
represent
.

What
killed
them
''
?

``
It
looks
like
we
did
COMMA
when
we
made
blastdown
''
.

``
But
what
about
our
landing
was
lethal
to
the
creatures
''
?

``
Radiation
''
?
Ekstrohm
suggested
.

``
The
planet
is
very
low
in
radiation
from
mineral
deposits
COMMA
and
the
atmosphere
seems
to
shield
out
most
of
the
solar
output
.

Any
little
dose
of
radiation
might
knock
off
these
critters
''
.

``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
.

Maybe
it
would
work
the
other
way
.

Maybe
because
they
have
had
virtually
no
radioactive
exposure
and
do
n't
have
any
R's
stored
up
COMMA
they
could
take
a
lot
without
harm
''
.

``
Then
maybe
it
was
the
shockwave
we
set
up
.

Or
maybe
it
's
sheer
xenophobia
.

They
curl
up
and
die
at
the
sight
of
something
strange
and
alien
--
like
a
spaceship
''
.

``
Maybe
''
COMMA
the
captain
admitted
.

``
At
this
stage
of
the
game
anything
could
be
possible
.

But
there
's
one
possibility
I
particularly
do
n't
like
''
.

``
And
that
is
''
?

``
Suppose
it
was
not
us
that
killed
these
aliens
.

Suppose
it
is
something
right
on
the
planet
COMMA
native
to
it
.

I
just
hope
it
does
n't
work
on
Earthmen
too
.

These
critters
went
real
sudden
''
.

Ekstrohm
lay
in
his
bunk
and
thought
COMMA
the
camp
is
quiet
.

The
Earthmen
made
camp
outside
the
spaceship
.

There
was
no
reason
to
leave
the
comfortable
quarters
inside
the
ship
COMMA
except
that
COMMA
faced
with
a
possibility
of
sleeping
on
solid
ground
COMMA
they
simply
had
to
get
out
.

The
camp
was
a
cluster
of
aluminum
bubbles
COMMA
ringed
with
a
spy
web
to
alert
the
Earthmen
to
the
approach
of
any
being
.

Each
man
had
a
bubble
to
himself
COMMA
privacy
after
the
long
period
of
enforced
intimacy
on
board
the
ship
.

Ekstrohm
lay
in
his
bunk
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
night
on
Yancey-6
138
.

There
was
a
keening
of
wind
COMMA
and
a
cracking
of
the
frozen
ground
.

Insects
there
were
on
the
world
COMMA
but
they
were
frozen
solid
during
the
night
COMMA
only
to
revive
and
thaw
in
the
morning
sun
.

The
bunk
he
lay
on
was
much
more
uncomfortable
than
the
acceleration
couches
on
board
.

Yet
he
knew
the
others
were
sleeping
more
soundly
COMMA
now
that
they
had
renewed
their
contact
with
the
matter
that
had
birthed
them
to
send
them
riding
high
vacuum
.

Ekstrohm
was
not
asleep
.

Now
there
could
be
an
end
to
pretending
.

He
threw
off
the
light
blanket
and
swung
his
feet
off
the
bunk
COMMA
to
the
floor
.

Ekstrohm
stood
up
.

There
was
no
longer
any
need
to
hide
.

But
what
was
there
to
do
?

What
had
changed
for
him
?

He
no
longer
had
to
lie
in
his
bunk
all
night
COMMA
his
eyes
closed
COMMA
pretending
to
sleep
.

In
privacy
he
could
walk
around
COMMA
leave
the
light
on
COMMA
read
.

It
was
small
comfort
for
insomnia
.

Ekstrohm
never
slept
.

Some
doctors
had
informed
him
he
was
mistaken
about
this
.

Actually
COMMA
they
said
COMMA
he
did
sleep
COMMA
but
so
shortly
and
fitfully
that
he
forgot
.

Others
admitted
he
was
absolutely
correct
--
he
never
slept
.

His
body
processes
only
slowed
down
enough
for
him
to
dispell
fatigue
poisons
.

Occasionally
he
fell
into
a
waking
COMMA
gritty-eyed
stupor
;
but
he
never
slept
.

Never
at
all
.

Naturally
COMMA
he
could
n't
let
his
shipmates
know
this
.

Insomnia
would
ground
him
from
the
Exploration
Service
COMMA
on
physiological
if
not
psychological
grounds
.

He
had
to
hide
it
.

Over
the
years
COMMA
he
had
had
buddies
in
space
in
whom
he
thought
he
could
confide
.

The
buddies
invariably
took
advantage
of
him
.

Since
he
could
n't
sleep
anyway
COMMA
he
might
as
well
stand
their
watches
for
them
or
write
their
reports
.

Where
the
hell
did
he
get
off
threatening
to
report
any
laxness
on
their
part
to
the
captain
?

A
man
with
insomnia
had
better
avoid
bad
dreams
of
that
kind
if
he
knew
what
was
good
for
him
.

Ekstrohm
had
to
hide
his
secret
.

In
a
camp
COMMA
instead
of
shipboard
COMMA
hiding
the
secret
was
easier
.

But
the
secret
itself
was
just
as
hard
.

Ekstrohm
picked
up
a
lightweight
no-back
from
the
ship
's
library
COMMA
a
book
by
Bloch
COMMA
the
famous
twentieth
century
expert
on
sex
.

He
scanned
a
few
lines
on
the
social
repercussions
of
a
celebrated
nineteenth
century
sex
murderer
COMMA
but
he
could
n't
seem
to
concentrate
on
the
weighty
COMMA
pontifical
COMMA
ponderous
style
.

On
impulse
COMMA
he
flipped
up
the
heat
control
on
his
coverall
and
slid
back
the
hatch
of
the
bubble
.

Ekstrohm
walked
through
the
alien
glass
and
looked
up
at
the
unfamiliar
constellations
COMMA
smelling
the
frozen
sterility
of
the
thin
air
.

Behind
him
COMMA
his
mates
stirred
without
waking
.

Ekstrohm
was
startled
in
the
morning
by
a
banging
on
the
hatch
of
his
bubble
.

It
took
him
a
few
seconds
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
COMMA
and
then
he
got
up
from
the
bunk
where
he
had
been
resting
COMMA
sleeplessly
.

The
angry
burnt-red
face
of
Ryan
greeted
him
.

``
Okay
COMMA
Stormy
COMMA
this
is
n't
the
place
for
fun
and
games
.

What
did
you
do
with
them
''
?

``
Do
with
what
''
?

``
The
dead
beasties
.

All
the
dead
animals
laying
around
the
ship
''
.

``
What
are
you
talking
about
COMMA
Ryan
?

What
do
you
think
I
did
with
them
''
?

``
I
do
n't
know
.

All
I
know
is
that
they
are
gone
''
.

``
Gone
''
?

Ekstrohm
shouldered
his
way
outside
and
scanned
the
veldt
.

There
was
no
ring
of
animal
corpses
.

Nothing
.

Nothing
but
wispy
grass
whipping
in
the
keen
breeze
.

``
I
'll
be
damned
''
COMMA
Ekstrohm
said
.

``
You
are
right
now
COMMA
buddy
.

ExPe
does
n't
like
anybody
mucking
up
primary
evidence
''
.

``
Where
do
you
get
off
COMMA
Ryan
''
?
Ekstrohm
demanded
.

``
Why
pick
me
for
your
patsy
?

This
has
got
to
be
some
kind
of
local
phenomenon
.

Why
accuse
a
shipmate
of
being
behind
this
''
?

``
Listen
COMMA
Ekstrohm
COMMA
I
want
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
.

But
you
are
n't
exactly
the
model
of
a
surveyor
COMMA
you
know
.

You
've
been
riding
on
a
pink
ticket
for
six
years
COMMA
you
know
that
''
.

``
No
''
COMMA
Ekstrohm
said
COMMA
``
No
COMMA
I
did
n't
know
that
''
.

``
You
've
been
hiding
things
from
me
and
Nogol
every
jump
we
've
made
with
you
.

Now
comes
this
!

It
fits
the
pattern
of
secrecy
and
stealth
you
've
been
involved
in
''
.

``
What
could
I
do
with
your
lousy
dead
bodies
?

What
would
I
want
with
them
''
?

``
All
I
know
is
that
you
were
outside
the
bubbles
last
night
COMMA
and
you
were
the
only
sentient
being
who
came
in
or
out
of
our
alarm
web
.

The
tapes
show
that
.

Now
all
the
bodies
are
missing
COMMA
like
they
got
up
and
walked
away
''
.

It
was
not
a
new
experience
to
Ekstrohm
.

No
.

Suspicion
was
n't
new
to
him
at
all
.

``
Ryan
COMMA
there
are
other
explanations
for
the
disappearance
of
the
bodies
.

Look
for
them
COMMA
will
you
?

I
give
you
my
word
I
'm
not
trying
to
pull
some
stupid
kind
of
joke
COMMA
or
to
deliberately
foul
up
the
expedition
.

Take
my
word
COMMA
ca
n't
you
''
?

Ryan
shook
his
head
.

``
I
do
n't
think
I
can
.

There
's
still
such
a
thing
as
mental
illness
.

You
may
not
be
responsible
''
.

Ekstrohm
scowled
.

``
Do
n't
try
anything
violent
COMMA
Stormy
.

I
outweigh
you
fifty
pounds
and
I
'm
fast
for
a
big
man
''
.

``
I
was
n't
planning
on
jumping
you
.

Why
do
you
have
to
jump
me
the
first
time
something
goes
wrong
?

Dan
Morgan
told
himself
he
would
forget
Ann
Turner
.

He
was
well
rid
of
her
.

He
certainly
did
n't
want
a
wife
who
was
fickle
as
Ann
.

If
he
had
married
her
COMMA
he
'd
have
been
asking
for
trouble
.

But
all
of
this
was
rationalization
.

Sometimes
he
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thinking
of
Ann
COMMA
and
then
could
not
get
back
to
sleep
.

His
plans
and
dreams
had
revolved
around
her
so
much
and
for
so
long
that
now
he
felt
as
if
he
had
nothing
.

The
easiest
thing
would
be
to
sell
out
to
Al
Budd
and
leave
the
country
COMMA
but
there
was
a
stubborn
streak
in
him
that
would
n't
allow
it
.

The
best
antidote
for
the
bitterness
and
disappointment
that
poisoned
him
was
hard
work
.

He
found
that
if
he
was
tired
enough
at
night
COMMA
he
went
to
sleep
simply
because
he
was
too
exhausted
to
stay
awake
.

Each
day
he
found
himself
thinking
less
often
of
Ann
;
each
day
the
hurt
was
a
little
duller
COMMA
a
little
less
poignant
.

He
had
plenty
of
work
to
do
.

Because
the
summer
was
unusually
dry
and
hot
COMMA
the
spring
produced
a
smaller
stream
than
in
ordinary
years
.

The
grass
in
the
meadows
came
fast
COMMA
now
that
the
warm
weather
was
here
.

He
could
not
afford
to
lose
a
drop
of
the
precious
water
COMMA
so
he
spent
most
of
his
waking
hours
along
the
ditches
in
his
meadows
.

He
had
no
idea
how
much
time
Budd
would
give
him
.

In
any
case
COMMA
he
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
asleep
COMMA
so
he
carried
his
revolver
in
its
holster
on
his
hip
and
he
took
his
Winchester
with
him
and
leaned
it
against
the
fence
.

He
stopped
every
few
minutes
and
leaned
on
his
shovel
as
he
studied
the
horizon
COMMA
but
nothing
happened
COMMA
each
day
dragging
out
with
monotonous
calm
.

When
COMMA
in
late
afternoon
on
the
last
day
in
June
COMMA
he
saw
two
people
top
the
ridge
to
the
south
and
walk
toward
the
house
COMMA
he
quit
work
immediately
and
strode
to
his
rifle
.

It
could
be
some
kind
of
trick
Budd
had
thought
up
.

No
one
walked
in
this
country
COMMA
least
of
all
Ed
Dow
or
Dutch
Renfro
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
Bar
B
crew
.

Morgan
watched
the
two
figures
for
a
time
COMMA
puzzled
.

When
they
were
closer
and
he
saw
that
one
was
a
woman
COMMA
he
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
.

He
cleaned
his
shovel
COMMA
left
it
against
the
fence
COMMA
picked
up
his
Winchester
COMMA
and
started
downstream
.

His
visitors
had
crawled
through
the
south
fence
and
were
crossing
the
meadow
COMMA
angling
toward
the
house
.

Now
he
saw
that
both
the
man
and
woman
were
moving
slowly
and
irregularly
COMMA
staggering
COMMA
as
if
they
found
it
a
struggle
to
remain
on
their
feet
.

Reaching
the
house
ahead
of
them
COMMA
he
waited
with
his
Winchester
in
his
hands
.

They
crawled
through
the
north
fence
and
came
on
toward
him
COMMA
and
now
he
saw
that
both
were
young
COMMA
not
more
than
nineteen
or
twenty
.

They
were
dirty
COMMA
their
clothes
were
torn
COMMA
and
the
girl
was
so
exhausted
that
she
fell
when
she
was
still
twenty
feet
from
the
front
door
.

She
lay
there
COMMA
making
no
effort
to
get
back
on
her
feet
.

The
boy
came
on
to
the
porch
and
sat
down
COMMA
his
gaze
on
Morgan
as
if
half
expecting
him
to
shoot
and
not
really
caring
.

Morgan
hesitated
COMMA
thinking
that
if
this
was
a
trick
COMMA
it
was
a
good
one
.

He
did
n't
think
it
was
possible
for
this
couple
to
be
pretending
.

The
boy
licked
his
dry
lips
.

He
asked
COMMA
``
Could
we
have
a
drink
''
?

Morgan
jerked
his
head
toward
the
front
door
.

``
In
the
kitchen
''
COMMA
he
said
.

Leaning
his
Winchester
against
the
front
of
the
house
COMMA
he
walked
to
the
girl
.

``
Get
up
.

There
's
water
in
the
house
''
.

She
did
n't
move
or
say
anything
.

Her
eyes
were
glazed
as
if
she
did
n't
hear
or
even
see
him
.

She
had
reached
a
point
at
which
she
did
n't
even
care
how
she
looked
.

Her
face
was
very
thin
COMMA
and
burned
by
the
sun
until
much
of
the
skin
was
dead
and
peeling
COMMA
the
new
skin
under
it
red
and
angry
.

Her
blond
hair
was
frowzy
COMMA
her
dress
torn
in
several
places
COMMA
and
her
shoes
were
so
completely
worn
out
that
they
were
practically
no
protection
.

It
must
have
hurt
her
even
to
walk
COMMA
for
the
sole
was
completely
off
her
left
foot
and
Morgan
saw
that
it
was
bruised
and
bleeding
.

He
picked
her
up
COMMA
sliding
one
hand
under
her
shoulders
COMMA
the
other
under
her
knees
COMMA
and
carried
her
into
the
house
.

She
was
amazingly
light
COMMA
and
so
relaxed
in
his
arms
that
he
was
n't
even
sure
she
was
conscious
.

Any
lingering
suspicion
that
this
was
a
trick
Al
Budd
had
thought
up
was
dispelled
.

No
girl
would
go
this
far
to
fool
a
man
so
she
could
kill
him
.

Besides
COMMA
she
had
a
sweet
face
that
attracted
him
.

He
put
her
down
on
the
couch
COMMA
and
going
into
the
kitchen
COMMA
saw
that
the
boy
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
.

They
looked
a
good
deal
alike
COMMA
Morgan
thought
.

Both
had
blonde
hair
and
blue
eyes
COMMA
and
there
was
even
a
faint
similarity
of
features
.

Morgan
filled
the
dipper
from
the
water
bucket
on
the
shelf
COMMA
went
back
into
the
front
room
COMMA
lifted
the
girl
's
head
COMMA
and
held
the
edge
of
the
dipper
to
her
mouth
.

She
drank
greedily
COMMA
and
murmured
COMMA
``
Thank
you
''
COMMA
as
he
lowered
her
head
.

He
stood
looking
down
at
her
for
a
moment
COMMA
wondering
what
could
have
reduced
her
to
this
condition
.

He
had
seen
a
few
nester
wagons
go
through
the
country
COMMA
the
families
almost
starving
to
death
COMMA
but
he
had
never
seen
any
of
them
on
foot
and
as
bad
off
as
these
two
.

The
girl
dropped
off
to
sleep
.

Morgan
returned
to
the
kitchen
COMMA
built
a
fire
COMMA
and
carried
in
several
buckets
of
water
from
the
spring
which
he
poured
into
the
copper
boiler
that
he
had
placed
on
the
stove
.

He
brought
his
Winchester
in
from
the
front
of
the
house
COMMA
then
faced
the
boy
.

``
Who
are
you
and
what
happened
to
you
''
?
He
asked
.

``
I
'm
Billy
Jones
''
COMMA
the
boy
answered
.

``
That
's
my
wife
Sharon
.

We
ran
out
of
money
and
we
have
n't
eaten
for
two
days
''
.

``
What
are
you
doing
here
''
?

``
Are
we
in
Wyoming
''
?

Morgan
nodded
.

``
About
five
miles
north
of
the
line
''
.

Jones
sighed
as
if
relieved
.

``
We
've
been
looking
for
work
COMMA
but
all
the
ranchers
have
turned
us
down
''
.

``
You
mean
you
dragged
your
wife
all
over
hell
's
half-acre
looking
for
work
''
?
Morgan
demanded
.

``
The
town
of
Buckhorn
's
only
about
six
miles
from
here
.

Why
did
n't
you
go
there
''
?

``
We
did
n't
want
town
work
''
COMMA
Jones
said
.

``
This
is
a
mighty
empty
country
''
COMMA
Morgan
said
.

``
There
's
only
one
more
ranch
three
miles
north
of
here
.

You
'd
have
starved
to
death
if
you
'd
missed
both
places
''
.

``
Then
we
're
lucky
we
got
here
.

Could
you
give
us
a
job
COMMA
Mr.
''

``
Morgan
.

Dan
Morgan
''
.

He
was
silent
a
moment
COMMA
thinking
he
could
use
a
man
this
time
of
year
COMMA
and
if
the
girl
could
cook
COMMA
it
would
give
him
more
time
in
the
meadows
COMMA
but
he
knew
nothing
about
the
couple
.

They
might
kill
him
in
his
sleep
COMMA
thinking
there
was
money
in
the
house
.

He
dismissed
the
possibility
at
once
.

The
girl
's
thin
face
haunted
him
.

It
was
n't
the
face
of
a
killer
.

He
was
n't
so
sure
about
the
boy
.

He
had
n't
shaved
for
several
weeks
COMMA
his
sparse
beard
giving
his
face
a
pathetic
COMMA
woebegone
expression
.

There
was
more
to
this
than
Jones
had
told
him
.

They
were
running
from
something
.

He
'd
be
an
idiot
to
let
them
stay
he
thought
COMMA
but
he
could
n't
send
them
on
COMMA
either
.

``
I
could
use
some
help
''
COMMA
Morgan
said
finally
COMMA
``
but
I
can
n't
afford
to
pay
you
anything
.

I
guess
you
'd
better
go
on
in
the
morning
''
.

``
We
'll
work
for
our
keep
''
COMMA
the
boy
said
eagerly
.

``
I
've
been
mucking
in
a
mine
in
the
San
Juan
COMMA
but
I
used
to
work
on
a
ranch
.

Sharon
COMMA
she
's
cooked
in
a
restaurant
.

We
'll
work
hard
COMMA
Mr.
Morgan
''
.

``
I
'll
see
''
COMMA
Morgan
said
.

``
Right
now
you
need
a
meal
and
a
bath
.

Your
wife
's
in
terrible
shape
''
.

``
I
know
''
COMMA
Jones
said
dejectedly
.

Morgan
filled
the
fire
box
with
wood
again
COMMA
then
started
supper
and
set
the
table
.

When
the
meal
was
ready
COMMA
he
told
Jones
to
wash
up
COMMA
and
going
into
the
front
room
COMMA
woke
the
girl
.

He
said
COMMA
``
I
've
got
some
supper
ready
''
.

She
rubbed
her
eyes
and
stretched
COMMA
then
sat
up
COMMA
her
hands
going
to
her
hair
.

``
I
'm
a
mess
''
COMMA
she
said
COMMA
and
suddenly
she
was
alarmed
.

``
Who
are
you
?

How
did
we
get
here
''
?

``
I
'm
Dan
Morgan
.

This
is
the
Rafter
A[fj]
.

You
fell
down
in
front
of
the
house
COMMA
and
I
carried
you
in
.

I
gave
you
a
drink
and
then
you
went
to
sleep
''
.

``
Oh
''
.

She
stared
at
him
COMMA
her
eyes
wide
as
she
thought
about
what
he
had
said
;
then
she
murmured
:
``
You
're
very
kind
COMMA
Mr.
Morgan
.

Do
you
take
in
all
the
strays
who
come
by
''
?

``
I
do
n't
have
many
strays
coming
to
my
front
door
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
Think
you
can
walk
to
the
table
''
?

``
Of
course
''
.

She
got
to
her
feet
COMMA
staggered
COMMA
and
almost
fell
.

He
caught
her
by
an
arm
and
helped
her
into
the
kitchen
.

She
sat
down
at
the
table
COMMA
shaking
her
head
.

``
I
'm
sorry
COMMA
Mr.
Morgan
.

I
'm
usually
a
very
strong
woman
COMMA
but
I
'm
awfully
tired
''
.

``
And
hungry
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
Start
in
.

It
's
not
much
of
a
meal
COMMA
but
it
's
what
I
eat
''
.

``
Not
much
of
a
meal
''
?
The
girl
cried
.

``
Mr.
Morgan
COMMA
it
's
the
best
-
looking
food
I
ever
saw
''
.

He
told
himself
he
had
never
seen
two
people
eat
so
much
.

When
they
were
finally
satisfied
COMMA
Jones
said
COMMA
``
I
think
he
's
going
to
give
us
work
''
.

The
grateful
way
she
looked
at
Morgan
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
.

When
he
saw
the
expression
in
her
eyes
COMMA
he
knew
he
could
n't
send
them
on
.

She
said
COMMA
``
I
guess
the
Lord
looks
out
for
fools
COMMA
drunkards
COMMA
and
innocents
''
.

Morgan
laughed
.

``
Which
are
you
''
?

``
We
're
not
drunkards
''
COMMA
she
said
.

``
That
's
all
I
'm
sure
of
''
.

She
helped
him
with
the
dishes
COMMA
then
he
brought
more
water
in
from
the
spring
before
it
got
dark
.

He
carried
the
tub
from
the
back
of
the
house
where
it
hung
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
.

He
said
:
``
You
'll
feel
a
lot
better
after
you
have
a
bath
.

Your
feet
are
in
bad
shape
COMMA
Mrs.
Jones
.

You
'll
have
to
go
to
town
to
see
the
doc
''
.

``
No
COMMA
she
'll
be
all
right
''
COMMA
Jones
said
quickly
.

``
I
mean
COMMA
we
do
n't
have
any
way
to
get
there
and
we
can
n't
expect
you
to
quit
work
just
to
take
us
to
town
''
.

``
We
'll
see
''
COMMA
Morgan
said
.

``
Could
you
find
me
a
needle
and
thread
''
?
The
girl
asked
.

``
My
dress
needs
some
work
on
it
''
.

He
nodded
and
COMMA
going
into
the
bedroom
COMMA
brought
a
needle
COMMA
thread
COMMA
and
scissors
.

He
said
:
``
I
'm
going
to
bed
''
.

He
nodded
at
the
door
in
front
of
him
.

``
That
's
my
spare
bedroom
.

The
bed
is
n't
made
COMMA
but
you
'll
find
plenty
of
blankets
there
''
.

``
You
're
awfully
kind
''
COMMA
the
girl
said
.

``
We
'll
pay
you
back
if
you
'll
let
us
.

Some
way
''
.

``
It
's
all
right
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
I
get
up
early
.

You
'd
better
sleep
''
.

Jones
followed
him
into
the
front
room
COMMA
closing
the
door
behind
him
.

He
said
:
``
If
it
's
all
right
with
you
COMMA
Mr.
Morgan
COMMA
I
'll
sleep
out
here
on
the
couch
.

We
have
n't
slept
together
since
we
started
.

I
just
can
n't
take
any
chances
on
getting
her
pregnant
COMMA
and
if
we
were
sleeping
together
''

He
stopped
COMMA
embarrassed
COMMA
and
Morgan
said
COMMA
``
I
understand
that
COMMA
but
I
do
n't
savvy
why
you
'd
go
off
and
leave
your
jobs
in
the
first
place
''
.

``
We
got
fired
''
COMMA
Jones
said
.

``
We
had
to
do
something
''
.

They
were
a
pair
of
lost
COMMA
whipped
kids
COMMA
Morgan
thought
as
he
went
to
bed
.

Gavin
paused
wearily
.

``
You
ca
n't
stay
here
with
me
.

It
's
late
and
you
said
they
'd
be
here
by
dawn
''
.

``
You
ca
n't
make
me
go
''
.

Gavin
sank
down
again
into
his
chair
and
began
to
rock
.

He
was
thinking
of
Rittenhouse
and
how
he
had
left
him
there
COMMA
to
rock
to
death
on
the
porch
of
the
Splendide
.

It
was
the
only
thing
in
his
life
for
which
he
felt
guilt
.

Beneath
his
black
shirt
his
frail
shoulders
shook
and
croaks
of
pain
broke
from
his
throat
COMMA
the
stored
pain
shattering
free
in
slow
gasps
COMMA
terrible
to
see
.

Clayton
tried
to
call
back
the
face
of
the
man
he
had
known
.

Against
that
other
man
he
could
rally
his
anger
;
against
this
bent
man
in
the
chair
he
was
powerless
.

Gavin
's
lips
moved
so
that
Clayton
had
to
stoop
to
catch
the
words
.

``
Do
you
remember
Big
Charlie
''
?
He
whispered
.

``
He
stuck
with
me
all
these
years
.

Just
a
half-breed
'pache
COMMA
never
said
much
COMMA
never
meant
anythin
to
me
COMMA
but
he
stuck
with
me
.

He
got
into
a
fight
with
Tom
English
COMMA
your
brother
's
son
.

It
was
a
fair
fight
COMMA
the
boy
provoked
it
--
Big
Charlie
told
me
so
.

I
believed
him
.

They
killed
Big
Charlie
COMMA
dumped
his
body
in
my
rose
garden
two
nights
ago
.

My
men
COMMA
they
all
left
me
.

Just
cleared
out
.

I
did
n't
understand
why
COMMA
Clay
.

They
just
all
cleared
out
.

I
treated
them
fair
''

He
wiped
his
lips
with
a
sleeve
COMMA
then
stared
at
Clayton
in
a
childish
kind
of
wonder
.

``
Do
you
mean
''
--
he
asked
almost
shyly
--
``
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
COMMA
wherever
you
're
goin
''
?

``
Yes
''
.

``
You
do
n't
hate
me
any
more
''
?

Clayton
choked
COMMA
shook
his
head
COMMA
murmuring
COMMA
``
No
''
.

``
Come
here
''
.

The
old
man
beckoned
with
one
finger
and
Clayton
went
forward
to
him
.

Gavin
slipped
his
arms
around
his
chest
and
hugged
him
fiercely
.

``
All
my
life
''
COMMA
he
said
COMMA
``
I
tried
.

I
tried
.

I
saw
you
driftin
away
--
but
I
tried
.

And
you
wanted
no
part
of
me
when
I
had
so
much
to
give
.

Now
there
's
nothin
left
of
me
.

Laurel
is
gone
COMMA
my
men
are
gone
COMMA
Ed
is
dead
--
and
you
come
to
me
COMMA
to
help
me
.

Oh
!

God
in
Heaven
COMMA
I
ca
n't
refuse
you
now
.

That
would
mock
me
too
much
!

Ca
n't
let
you
go
way
from
me
again
''

He
closed
his
eyes
COMMA
ashamed
of
his
tears
.

``
I
'll
go
COMMA
Clay
''
.

Clayton
freed
himself
from
the
embrace
and
stepped
back
.

The
eyes
followed
him
fearfully
.

``
The
horses
.

There
is
n't
much
time
.

I
'll
saddle
the
horses
and
bring
them
round
.

You
get
ready
''

He
burst
from
the
hot
confinement
of
the
room
into
the
cold
night
air
.

Gavin
's
stallion
was
in
the
barn
and
he
tightened
the
cinches
over
the
saddle
blanket
COMMA
working
by
touch
in
the
darkness
COMMA
comforting
the
animal
with
easy
words
.

When
he
had
finished
he
led
him
and
the
mare
to
the
porch
.

The
stallion
had
smelled
the
mare
coming
into
heat
and
began
to
paw
the
turf
COMMA
shaking
his
head
.

Clayton
looped
the
reins
in
a
knot
over
the
veranda
post
and
patted
the
warm
flesh
of
his
neck
.

The
mare
had
backed
away
.

``
You
take
it
easy
COMMA
boy
''
COMMA
Clayton
whispered
.

``
She
does
n't
want
you
now
.

You
take
it
easy
COMMA
your
time
will
come
''
.

Gavin
stood
on
the
porch
COMMA
a
thin
figure
.

He
had
taken
a
carbine
down
from
the
wall
and
it
trailed
from
his
hand
COMMA
the
stock
bumping
on
the
wood
floor
.

Clayton
called
to
him
and
he
came
slowly
down
the
steps
.

``
Clay
''
COMMA
he
said
COMMA
``
where
are
we
goin
''
?

``
To
a
ranch
in
the
valley
.

There
's
someone
there
I
have
to
see
.

We
may
take
her
with
us
--
to
California
.

I
do
n't
know
yet
COMMA
it
's
crazy
;
I
have
to
think
about
it
.

But
California
is
where
we
're
goin
''
.

``
California
''
.

Gavin
began
to
nod
.

``
That
's
a
new
land
.

A
man
could
make
a
mark
there
.

Two
men
COMMA
together
like
us
COMMA
we
could
do
somethin
fine
out
there
COMMA
maybe
find
a
place
where
no
one
's
ever
been
.

Start
out
fresh
COMMA
the
two
of
us
COMMA
like
nothin
had
ever
happened
''
.

``
Yes
COMMA
like
a
father
and
son
''
.

``
I
made
you
what
you
are
''
COMMA
Gavin
whispered
.

``
I
made
you
so
you
could
stand
up
.

I
made
you
a
man
''
.

``
Yes
COMMA
Gavin
COMMA
you
did
''
.

He
approached
the
horse
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
stallion
's
quivering
neck
.

``
Help
me
up
COMMA
Clay
.

Help
me
up
COMMA
I
feel
kind
of
stiff
''
.

Clayton
lifted
him
gently
into
the
saddle
COMMA
like
a
child
.

``
I
hate
to
leave
my
garden
''
COMMA
Gavin
said
.

``
They
'll
trample
it
down
.

I
loved
my
garden
''
.

``
It
will
grow
again
--
in
California
''
.

``
I
loved
this
valley
''
COMMA
he
whispered
huskily
.

``
Lived
alone
here
for
three
years
COMMA
before
any
man
came
.

Lived
alone
by
the
river
.

It
was
nice
then
COMMA
so
peaceful
and
quiet
.

There
was
no
one
but
me
.

I
do
n't
want
to
leave
it
''
.

Clayton
swung
into
the
saddle
and
whacked
the
stallion
's
rump
.

The
two
horses
broke
from
the
yard
COMMA
from
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
lamp
still
burning
in
the
house
COMMA
into
the
darkness
.

Thirty-five

they
rode
at
a
measured
pace
through
the
valley
.

Dawn
would
come
soon
and
the
night
was
at
its
coldest
.

The
moon
had
sunk
below
the
black
crest
of
the
mountains
and
the
land
COMMA
seen
through
eyes
that
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
absence
of
light
COMMA
looked
primeval
COMMA
as
if
no
man
had
ever
trespassed
before
.

It
looked
as
Gavin
had
first
seen
it
years
ago
COMMA
on
those
nights
when
he
slept
alone
by
his
campfire
and
waked
suddenly
to
the
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
rustle
of
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
moon
's
wind
--
a
savage
land
COMMA
untenanted
and
brooding
COMMA
too
strong
to
be
broken
by
the
will
of
men
.

Gavin
sighed
bitterly
.

In
that
inert
landscape
the
caravan
of
his
desires
passed
before
his
mind
.

He
saw
them
ambushed
COMMA
strewn
in
the
postures
of
the
broken
and
the
dying
.

In
vain
his
mind
groped
to
reassemble
the
bones
of
the
relationships
he
had
sought
so
desperately
COMMA
but
they
would
not
come
to
life
.

The
silence
oppressed
him
COMMA
made
him
bend
low
over
the
horse
's
neck
as
if
to
hide
from
a
wind
that
had
begun
to
blow
far
away
and
was
twisting
slowly
through
the
darkness
in
its
slow
search
.

They
passed
ranches
that
were
framed
dark
gray
against
the
black
hills
.

Then
at
last
the
darkness
began
to
dissolve
.

A
bold
line
of
violet
broke
loose
from
the
high
ridge
of
the
mountains
COMMA
followed
by
feathers
of
red
that
swept
the
last
stars
from
the
sky
.

The
wan
light
spread
over
the
ground
and
the
valley
revealed
in
the
first
glimmer
the
contours
of
trees
and
fences
and
palely
shadowed
gullies
.

They
had
been
seen
as
soon
as
they
left
the
ranch
COMMA
picked
out
of
the
darkness
by
the
weary
though
watchful
eyes
of
two
men
posted
a
few
hundred
yards
away
in
the
windless
shelter
of
the
trees
.

The
two
men
whipped
their
horses
into
town
and
flung
themselves
up
the
steps
of
the
saloon
COMMA
crying
their
intelligence
.

The
men
in
Pettigrew
's
were
tired
from
a
night
's
drinking
COMMA
their
faces
red
and
baggy
.

But
the
liquor
had
flushed
their
courage
.

They
greeted
the
news
angrily
COMMA
as
though
they
had
been
cheated
of
purpose
.

Lester
heard
their
muttering
COMMA
saw
their
eyes
reveal
their
desire
.

He
worked
his
tongue
round
and
round
in
the
hollow
of
his
cheek
and
his
voice
came
out
of
his
throat
COMMA
dry
and
cracked
.

``
He
's
leavin
.

That
's
what
you
wanted
COMMA
is
n't
it
?

Clayton
is
with
him
COMMA
takin
him
out
of
the
valley
.

You
ca
n't
''
--

``
Keep
out
of
this
''
COMMA
Purvis
snarled
.

``
He
's
not
your
brother
COMMA
he
's
Gavin
's
son
.

You
see
COMMA
he
lied
to
us
when
he
said
he
was
leavin
alone
''
.

Joe
Purvis
was
thinking
back
many
years
.

First
he
thought
of
the
time
he
had
ridden
to
Gavin
and
told
him
how
his
cattle
were
being
rustled
at
the
far
end
of
the
valley
.

He
remembered
Gavin
's
smirk
COMMA
his
own
cringing
feeling
COMMA
his
impotence
.

Then
he
thought
of
a
time
when
Clayton
's
horse
had
fallen
lame
in
the
Gap
.

His
wife
had
said
to
him
:
``
Nellie
is
in
love
with
Clayton
Roy
.

He
would
n't
even
dance
with
her
at
Gavin
's
party
.

He
treats
her
like
she
was
dirt
.

And
you
stand
by
like
a
fool
and
let
him
do
it
''

He
remembered
Clayton
's
mocking
smile
in
the
saloon
when
he
had
asked
him
what
he
would
do
if
they
brought
their
cattle
to
water
.

It
was
the
night
Clayton
had
tricked
them
in
the
poker
game
.

``
You
're
Gavin
's
son
''
COMMA
Joe
Purvis
had
said
.

He
turned
to
Lester
.

``
You
brought
him
back
to
this
valley
thinkin
he
would
help
you
find
your
boy
.

He
meant
to
help
Gavin
all
the
time
.

He
made
a
fool
of
you
COMMA
Lester
''
.

He
swung
round
to
the
other
men
--
``
We
can
catch
him
easy
!

There
are
plenty
of
fresh
horses
halfway
at
my
place
.

If
we
let
them
go
COMMA
they
wo
n't
stay
away
COMMA
they
'll
find
men
to
ride
with
them
and
they
'll
be
back
.

There
's
only
one
way
they
can
get
out
now
and
that
's
through
the
Gap
--
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
take
them
''
.

Lester
's
hand
fluttered
to
Cabot
's
shoulder
.

The
boy
jerked
away
.

``
He
killed
Tom
--
do
you
understand
that
''
?

Cabot
turned
back
to
the
men
and
he
was
drunk
with
the
thing
they
would
do
COMMA
wild
to
break
from
the
cloying
warmth
of
the
saloon
into
the
cold
of
the
ebbing
night
.

He
fled
through
the
door
and
down
the
steps
COMMA
running
COMMA
and
the
men
grunted
and
followed
COMMA
pushing
Lester
to
one
side
where
he
backed
against
the
wall
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
raised
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
light
.

Purvis
and
Silas
Pettigrew
were
the
last
to
leave
.

They
mounted
up
and
rode
slowly
behind
the
others
at
a
safe
distance
.

Thirty-six

in
the
cold
dawn
the
mist
swirled
low
to
the
ground
COMMA
then
rose
with
a
gust
of
sudden
wind
to
leave
the
valley
clear
.

The
clouds
parted
and
hard
gashes
of
sunlight
swooped
down
to
stain
the
earth
with
streaks
of
white
and
gold
light
so
that
the
shadows
of
the
running
horses
flowed
like
dark
streams
over
the
dazzling
snow
.

When
they
turned
in
the
saddle
they
could
see
the
men
behind
them
COMMA
strung
out
on
the
prairie
in
a
flat
black
line
.

The
wind
of
their
running
was
cold
and
wild
COMMA
the
horses
were
lathered
and
their
manes
streamed
like
stiff
black
pennants
in
the
wind
.

The
mare
began
to
tire
and
Clayton
felt
the
spray
of
snow
from
the
hoofs
of
Gavin
's
stallion
.

He
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
thin
dotting
of
pursuers
.

They
neither
gained
nor
fell
back
.

He
rode
low
on
the
mare
's
neck
.

Ahead
of
him
Gavin
turned
slightly
off
the
trail
and
pointed
for
the
Gap
COMMA
no
more
than
a
mile
away
.

Gavin
's
face
was
bloodless
with
excitement
.

He
did
not
look
back
;
he
could
feel
more
than
hear
the
staccato
beat
of
hoofs
that
fanned
out
across
the
prairie
to
the
north
.

He
knew
who
was
riding
after
him
--
the
men
he
had
known
all
his
life
COMMA
the
men
who
had
worked
for
him
COMMA
sworn
their
loyalty
to
him
.

Now
they
were
riding
to
kill
him
.

And
he
was
fleeing
COMMA
running
--
fleeing
his
death
and
his
life
at
the
same
time
.

The
land
over
which
he
sped
was
the
land
he
had
created
and
lived
in
:
his
valley
.

With
every
leaping
stride
of
the
horse
beneath
him
he
crossed
one
more
patch
of
earth
that
had
been
his
COMMA
that
he
would
never
see
again
.

The
Gap
looming
before
him
--
the
place
where
had
confronted
Jack
English
on
that
day
so
many
years
ago
--
was
his
exit
from
all
that
had
meaning
to
him
.

California
is
too
far
COMMA
he
thought
.

He
would
never
reach
California
.

He
was
too
old
--
when
he
passed
up
and
through
the
corridor
of
pines
that
lined
the
trail
he
could
see
ahead
COMMA
he
was
passing
from
life
.

The
sentry
was
not
dead
.

He
was
COMMA
in
fact
COMMA
showing
signs
of
reviving
.

He
had
been
carrying
an
Enfield
rifle
and
a
holstered
navy
cap
-
and
-
ball
pistol
.

A
bayonet
hung
in
a
belt
scabbard
.

He
was
partially
uniformed
in
a
cavalry
tunic
and
hat
.

Mike
stripped
these
from
him
and
donned
them
.

He
and
Dean
tied
and
gagged
the
man
COMMA
using
his
belt
and
shirt
for
the
purpose
.

They
dragged
him
inside
the
building
.

Fiske
joined
them
COMMA
unsteady
on
his
feet
.

Julia
COMMA
seeing
the
bandage
COMMA
rushed
to
him
.

``
You
are
hurt
''
!
She
breathed
.

``
I
never
felt
better
in
my
life
''
COMMA
Fiske
blustered
.

He
turned
to
Susan
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
.

``
Thank
you
COMMA
My
dear
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
You
are
very
brave
''
.

Mike
silenced
them
.

``
We
'll
talk
later
.

First
COMMA
we
've
got
to
get
out
of
here
''
.

``
We
'll
grab
horses
''
COMMA
Dean
said
.

``
The
main
bunch
is
outside
COMMA
but
there
are
some
over
there
inside
the
wall
''
.

Mike
debated
it
COMMA
trying
to
decide
whether
Fiske
was
strong
enough
to
ride
.

But
it
at
least
offered
him
a
chance
for
living
.

He
had
none
here
.

And
COMMA
for
the
sake
of
Julia
and
Susan
COMMA
it
had
to
be
tried
.

The
guerrilla
bivouac
remained
silent
.

Light
showed
in
the
orderly
room
across
the
parade
ground
.

Someone
evidently
was
on
duty
there
.

No
doubt
there
would
be
men
guarding
the
horses
.

About
a
dozen
animals
were
held
inside
the
stockade
COMMA
as
best
Mike
could
make
out
in
the
moonlight
.

Evidently
this
was
a
precaution
so
that
mounts
would
be
available
in
an
emergency
.

He
handed
the
guard
's
rifle
to
Fiske
.

``
Dean
and
myself
will
try
to
cut
out
horses
to
ride
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
We
'll
stampede
the
rest
.

You
stay
with
the
ladies
.

All
of
you
be
ready
to
ride
hell
for
leather
''
.

He
added
COMMA
``
If
this
does
n't
work
out
COMMA
the
three
of
you
barricade
yourself
in
the
house
and
talk
terms
with
them
''
.

He
handed
the
bayonet
to
Dean
and
kept
the
pistol
.

Susan
halted
Dean
and
kissed
him
.

She
clung
to
him
COMMA
talking
to
him
COMMA
and
dabbing
at
her
eyes
.

Mike
turned
away
.

He
was
thinking
that
the
way
she
had
responded
to
his
own
kiss
had
n't
meant
what
he
had
believed
it
had
.

He
felt
unutterably
weary
.

Dean
turned
from
Susan
and
took
Julia
Fortune
in
his
arms
.

He
kissed
her
also
COMMA
and
with
deep
tenderness
.

She
too
began
to
weep
.

He
released
her
and
joined
Mike
.

``
All
right
''
COMMA
he
said
.

Mike
only
said
COMMA
``
Later
''
.

``
Be
careful
COMMA
McLish
''
!
Susan
said
fiercely
.

``
The
way
you
were
careful
''
?
He
snorted
.

``
Running
around
in
the
moonlight
almost
naked
and
slugging
a
man
with
a
rock
''
?

He
kept
going
.

He
wanted
no
more
sentimental
scenes
with
her
.

He
might
say
or
do
something
foolish
.

Something
all
of
them
would
regret
.

He
might
tell
her
how
sorry
a
spectacle
she
was
making
of
herself
COMMA
pretending
to
be
blind
to
the
way
Julia
Fortune
had
taken
Dean
's
affections
from
her
.

And
using
him
COMMA
Mike
McLish
COMMA
as
a
sop
to
her
pride
.

He
handed
the
bayonet
to
Dean
and
kept
the
pistol
.

``
Stay
well
back
of
me
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
I
'm
going
to
walk
up
to
the
horses
COMMA
bold
as
brass
COMMA
pretending
I
'm
one
of
the
guerrillas
.

There
's
bound
to
be
someone
on
guard
COMMA
but
the
hat
might
fool
them
long
enough
for
me
to
get
close
''
.

Holding
the
pistol
concealed
COMMA
he
walked
to
the
rear
wall
of
the
stockade
.

It
was
pierced
by
a
wagon
gate
built
of
two
wings
.

One
wing
stood
open
.

Mike
passed
through
it
and
moved
toward
the
dark
mass
of
horses
.

They
were
tethered
COMMA
army
style
COMMA
on
stable
lines
.

A
voice
spoke
near
-
at
-
hand
.

``
Who
's
that
''
?

Just
me
''
COMMA
Mike
said
.

``
Is
that
you
COMMA
Bill
''
?

He
located
his
man
.

The
guard
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
stockade
wall
just
out
of
reach
of
the
moonlight
.

Mike
kept
walking
and
got
within
arm
's
reach
before
the
man
became
suspicious
and
straightened
from
his
lax
slouch
.

Mike
struck
with
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
.

But
the
luck
that
had
been
running
their
way
left
him
.

The
guard
instinctively
parried
the
blow
with
his
rifle
.

He
tried
to
veer
the
rifle
around
to
fire
into
Mike
's
body
.

Mike
COMMA
off
balance
COMMA
managed
to
bat
the
muzzle
away
a
moment
before
it
exploded
.

The
bullet
went
wide
.

Mike
swung
the
pistol
in
a
savage
backlash
.

This
time
it
connected
solidly
on
the
man
's
temple
COMMA
felling
him
.

The
explosion
of
the
rifle
had
crashed
against
the
walls
of
the
stockade
and
the
deep
echoes
were
still
rolling
in
the
hills
.

The
startled
horses
began
rearing
on
their
tethers
.

Dean
came
rushing
up
.

``
Are
you
hit
''
?
He
demanded
.

``
No
COMMA
but
the
fat
's
in
the
fire
''
!
Mike
said
.

``
There
's
no
chance
now
of
all
of
us
getting
away
.

You
'll
have
to
try
it
alone
''
.

The
sentry
's
saddled
horse
stood
picketed
nearby
COMMA
having
been
kept
handy
in
case
of
need
.

Mike
took
the
bayonet
from
Dean
's
hand
and
slashed
the
picket
line
.

``
Up
you
go
''
!
He
said
.

``
Ride
''
!

Dean
resisted
Mike
's
attempt
to
push
him
toward
the
horse
.

``
Why
not
you
''
?
He
protested
.

``
Dammit
''
!
Mike
said
frantically
.

``
You
're
lighter
than
me
.

It
's
our
only
chance
now
.

Try
to
find
these
Feds
.

The
rest
of
us
can
fort
up
in
the
house
and
hang
on
until
you
get
back
.

You
're
the
one
that
's
taking
the
big
chance
''
.

Dean
still
hesitated
COMMA
but
Mike
lifted
him
almost
bodily
into
the
saddle
and
thrust
the
reins
in
his
hand
.

``
No
telling
how
good
this
horse
is
''
COMMA
Mike
panted
.

``
Favor
him
and
save
something
in
case
you
hit
trouble
.

Watch
out
for
Apaches
when
it
comes
daylight
.

Take
the
pistol
.

You
might
need
it
.

We
'll
still
have
the
rifle
COMMA
and
I
might
be
able
to
round
up
some
more
.

I
'll
stampede
the
rest
of
these
horses
so
they
ca
n't
chase
you
''
.

Dean
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
gave
him
a
mighty
whack
on
the
back
.

``
McLish
''
COMMA
he
said
as
he
kicked
the
horse
into
motion
COMMA
``
I
'd
be
a
mighty
sad
man
if
we
never
met
again
''
.

Then
he
was
on
his
way
at
a
gallop
.

Mike
ran
down
the
line
COMMA
slashing
picket
ropes
with
the
bayonet
.

He
lifted
a
screeching
war
whoop
.

That
touched
off
a
total
stampede
.

He
darted
inside
the
stockade
and
freed
the
horses
there
.

These
poured
through
the
gate
and
joined
the
flight
.

The
animals
thundered
away
into
the
moonlight
COMMA
heading
for
the
ridges
.

The
guerrillas
were
swarming
from
their
bivouac
at
the
west
end
of
the
enclosure
.

``
Apaches
''
!
Mike
yelled
.

``
They
're
stealin'
the
stock
''
!

He
scuttled
in
shadow
along
the
east
wall
of
the
stockade
and
then
followed
the
south
wall
until
he
was
at
the
rear
of
the
two
frame
buildings
.

He
crouched
there
.

His
shout
had
been
taken
up
and
repeated
.

The
guerrillas
were
running
across
the
parade
ground
and
through
the
rear
gate
in
the
wake
of
the
departing
horses
.

All
were
carrying
guns
they
had
seized
up
COMMA
but
they
were
half
-
clad
or
hardly
clad
at
all
.

Durkin
and
Calhoun
came
running
from
the
post
.

They
had
pistols
in
their
hands
.

They
bawled
questions
that
were
not
answered
in
the
uproar
.

They
followed
the
others
toward
the
east
gate
.

Beyond
the
stockade
rifles
began
to
explode
as
some
of
the
guerrillas
fired
at
shadows
that
they
imagined
were
Apaches
.

Mike
made
a
dash
to
the
rear
of
the
frame
buildings
.

He
crawled
beneath
the
two
supply
wagons
which
stood
between
the
buildings
and
peered
around
a
corner
.

The
area
was
deserted
.

A
man
was
standing
in
the
open
door
of
the
lighted
orderly
room
a
few
yards
to
Mike
's
left
COMMA
but
he
COMMA
too
COMMA
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
and
went
racing
to
join
the
confused
activity
at
the
east
end
of
the
stockade
.

Mike
crawled
to
the
door
and
peered
in
.

The
orderly
room
seemed
to
be
deserted
.

A
lantern
hung
from
a
peg
COMMA
giving
light
.

Ducking
inside
COMMA
he
found
that
three
rifles
were
stacked
in
a
corner
.

A
brace
of
pistols
COMMA
holstered
on
belts
COMMA
hung
from
a
peg
COMMA
along
with
ammunition
pouches
.

An
ammunition
case
stood
open
COMMA
containing
canisters
which
contained
powder
cartridges
.

Mike
seized
a
blanket
from
a
pallet
in
a
corner
COMMA
spread
it
on
the
floor
and
used
it
to
form
a
bag
in
which
he
placed
his
booty
.

Shouldering
the
load
he
peered
from
the
door
.

His
looting
of
the
orderly
room
had
taken
only
a
minute
or
two
and
the
vicinity
was
still
clear
of
guerrillas
.

He
looked
at
the
looming
hoods
of
the
supply
wagons
COMMA
struck
by
a
new
inspiration
.

He
set
his
bundle
down
.

Snatching
the
lantern
from
its
peg
COMMA
he
shattered
its
globe
with
a
blow
against
a
post
.

He
picked
up
the
powder
canister
and
ran
out
.

Bursting
paper
cartridges
COMMA
he
scattered
powder
beneath
the
nearest
wagon
and
dumped
the
contents
of
the
canister
upon
it
.

He
shouldered
the
blanket
again
COMMA
backed
off
COMMA
and
tossed
the
lantern
with
its
open
wick
beneath
the
wagon
.

He
turned
and
raced
across
the
parade
ground
toward
the
rock
house
.

Powder
flame
gushed
beneath
the
wagon
.

The
stockade
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
guerrillas
sighted
him
.

They
realized
the
truth
.

Bullets
began
to
snap
past
him
.

One
struck
the
muzzle
of
one
of
the
rifles
that
projected
from
the
shoulder
pack
.

Its
force
spun
him
around
COMMA
but
he
recovered
and
got
into
stride
again
.

A
bullet
tore
the
earth
from
beneath
his
foot
when
he
was
a
stride
or
two
from
safety
.

Another
struck
him
heavily
in
the
thigh
and
he
went
down
.

Guerrillas
were
racing
toward
him
.

Susan
and
Julia
came
from
the
door
and
dragged
him
with
them
.

The
three
of
them
floundered
through
the
door
into
the
interior
and
fell
in
a
heap
.

Susan
bounced
to
her
feet
and
slammed
the
door
.

She
crouched
aside
as
bullets
beat
at
the
portal
COMMA
chewing
into
the
planks
.

Some
tore
entirely
through
the
whipsawed
post
oak
.

The
iron
hinges
held
COMMA
but
the
planks
were
in
danger
of
being
torn
from
the
crossbars
.

Mike
rolled
to
Susan
COMMA
grasped
her
around
the
knees
COMMA
dragging
her
off
her
feet
.

He
hovered
over
her
to
shield
her
COMMA
for
spent
bullets
were
thudding
against
the
rear
walls
.

He
peered
from
a
loophole
.

Guerrillas
were
only
a
dozen
yards
away
COMMA
charging
the
house
.

Mike
snatched
a
pistol
from
the
heap
of
scattered
booty
and
fired
.

He
dropped
a
man
with
the
first
bullet
.

At
the
same
moment
Wheeler
Fiske
fired
the
rifle
Mike
had
given
him
and
another
guerrilla
was
hit
.

That
halted
the
rush
.

The
guerrillas
scattered
for
cover
.

The
wagons
were
burning
fiercely
.

The
mudwagon
had
caught
fire
also
.

The
blaze
was
spreading
to
the
frame
buildings
.

The
guerrillas
realized
they
faced
a
new
problem
.

``
Gawdamighty
''
!
One
screeched
.

``
There
goes
our
grub
an'
ammunition
''
!

``
Get
a
bucket
line
going
''
!
Calhoun
shouted
.

``
Hurry
!

Hurry
''
!

The
guerrillas
began
a
frantic
search
for
pails
in
which
to
bring
water
from
the
spring
.

But
what
few
containers
they
found
were
inadequate
.

Many
of
them
COMMA
in
increasing
panic
COMMA
came
running
with
water
in
their
hats
in
a
ludicrous
effort
.

Both
buildings
were
in
flames
.

The
heat
drove
the
guerrillas
back
.

The
roof
of
the
command
post
began
to
buckle
.

``
Drag
the
wagons
to
the
spring
''
!
Lew
Durkin
yelled
.

``
Run
'em
right
into
the
spring
!

Hustle
''
!

One
of
the
wagons
erupted
a
massive
pillar
of
flame
.

A
sizable
supply
of
powder
had
been
touched
off
.

The
wagons
and
the
coach
were
beyond
saving
and
so
were
the
buildings
.

The
glow
of
the
fire
reached
through
the
openings
in
the
windows
COMMA
giving
light
enough
to
examine
Mike
's
wound
.

The
bullet
had
torn
through
the
flesh
just
above
the
knee
COMMA
inflicting
an
ugly
gash
that
was
forming
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
.

But
it
had
missed
the
bone
and
had
passed
on
through
.

Susan
and
Julia
ripped
strips
from
their
clothing
and
bound
the
injury
.

Mike
tested
the
leg
and
found
that
he
was
able
to
hobble
around
on
it
.

``
Thrifty
of
her
to
use
it
up
.

Unusual
in
a
case
like
this
COMMA
but
''
--

``
You
can
joke
!

Did
n't
you
read
it
?

She
's
married
that
tenant
!
''

``
I
read
it
COMMA
yes
.

This
ought
to
simplify
Tolley
's
life
''
.

Laban
had
more
to
say
.

Tolley
had
gone
to
live
in
California
.

He
'd
mentioned
it
COMMA
himself
COMMA
at
church
and
everybody
seemed
to
have
the
idea
that
Tolley
had
left
because
Jenny
had
jilted
him
for
Roy
Robards
.

``
It
was
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
that
they
're
laughing
about
it
COMMA
Mamma
.

Zion
stayed
to
get
my
pin
COMMA
but
it
'll
be
a
cold
day
in
June
when
I
go
back
''
.

``
We
will
both
go
back
COMMA
Laban
''
!

Kizzie
turned
to
go
inside
.

``
Let
me
stay
and
take
the
pictures
you
wanted
COMMA
Mamma
.

The
sun
's
right
''
--

``
Pictures
''
?

She
swung
around
.

``
What
pictures
''
?

``
In
Brace
's
room
!

You
told
me
to
bring
my
camera
.

I
'm
not
going
back
''
--

``
Indeed
you
are
!

Why
should
I
want
pictures
of
an
empty
room
now
?

Tolley
had
no
idea
of
marrying
that
sneaky
little
Jenny
!

This
--
trip
of
his
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
consorting
with
tenants
COMMA
and
I
am
going
to
see
that
everybody
at
Mt.
Pleasant
understands
that
simple
fact
.

Wait
for
me
COMMA
Laban
COMMA
I
'll
be
dressed
in
half
a
second
''
!

Frank
followed
her
into
the
bedroom
COMMA
hooked
her
dress
up
the
back
.

``
Hurry
COMMA
Frank
!

They
're
not
going
to
laugh
at
the
Fairbrothers
and
Labans
very
long
!

Tolley
's
going
is
my
fault
.

I
drove
him
away
.

You
know
it
and
I
'll
tell
everybody
exactly
how
it
happened
''
.

She
was
so
beautiful
COMMA
so
valiant
COMMA
so
pitiable
.

He
kissed
her
.

``
Make
your
confession
to
God
COMMA
Kizzie
dear
COMMA
not
to
the
congregation
''
.

``
I
'll
decide
that
when
I
get
there
.

I
was
so
cruel
to
Tolley
COMMA
so
unfair
.

But
I
'll
be
fair
now
!

He
is
coming
back
COMMA
is
n't
he
COMMA
Frank
''
?

Yes
COMMA
oh
yes
.

What
else
was
there
to
say
?

Returning
to
the
log
-
house
he
found
some
favorite
lines
from
Jonathan
Swift
on
his
lips
:
``
Under
the
window
in
stormy
weather
I
marry
this
man
and
woman
together
.

Let
none
but
Him
who
rules
the
thunder
Put
this
man
and
woman
asunder
''
.

Absolution
for
his
lie
?

He
questioned
God
's
taking
time
to
telegraph
the
message
COMMA
but
he
felt
better
about
Kizzie
COMMA
and
he
took
the
sealed
envelope
from
its
pigeonhole
COMMA
wondering
why
he
had
preserved
it
.

If
he
died
before
she
did
COMMA
she
would
never
be
unable
to
resist
opening
it
.

In
any
case
he
would
be
thrusting
a
burden
on
his
remaining
sons
COMMA
making
them
parties
to
a
deception
peculiarly
his
own
.

It
was
simply
his
necessity
to
confess
which
had
made
him
write
and
keep
this
thing
.

``
You
've
told
God
COMMA
Frank
''
COMMA
he
said
.

``
Why
lacerate
the
--
congregation
''
?

Reaching
for
an
old
clay
pot
COMMA
relic
of
pioneer
days
COMMA
he
tore
the
envelope
in
pieces
COMMA
dropping
them
into
it
COMMA
touching
the
little
pyre
to
flame
COMMA
watching
it
curl
COMMA
the
red
sealing
wax
melting
and
bubbling
in
the
feathery
ash
.

Surely
now
his
beloved
son
could
rest
in
peace
.

``
'
And
let
me
go
COMMA
for
the
night
gathers
me
COMMA
and
in
the
night
shall
no
man
gather
fruit
'
''
.

A
beautiful
and
haunting
line
COMMA
a
subtle
genius
COMMA
Swinburne
COMMA
difficult
not
to
envy
a
gifted
man
COMMA
and
perhaps
he
did
.

But
there
were
great
satisfactions
COMMA
even
for
a
small
man
.

Beyond
his
window
were
the
greening
trees
COMMA
new
spring
COMMA
eternal
hope
COMMA
eternal
life
.

There
lay
Grand
Fair
's
Quinzaine
COMMA
his
own
young
parents
'
graves
COMMA
but
new
life
and
promise
for
his
sons
COMMA
grandsons
.

He
poured
his
thimble
of
wine
for
the
toast
he
'd
made
so
often
.

``
To
absent
loved
ones
''
.

But
this
last
time
he
drank
not
to
Brace
but
``
To
Tolley
''
!

Mr.
Robards
--
Jenny
was
the
only
person
she
knew
of
in
the
Mt.
Pleasant
neighborhood
who
called
him
that
--
was
kind
but
too
easygoing
.

It
did
n't
bother
him
for
everybody
from
the
blacksmith
to
the
preacher
to
say
COMMA
``
Howdy
COMMA
Miss
Jenny
''
COMMA
adding
a
careless
``
Roy
''
COMMA
but
it
did
her
.

He
could
put
a
stop
to
it
COMMA
she
told
him
again
and
again
.

Simply
call
Mr.
Whipsnade
Oscar
COMMA
and
Dr.
Dunne
P.GA
COMMA
and
C'un
Major
Frank
.

Mr.
Robards
laughed
COMMA
said
he
'd
feel
a
damn
fool
COMMA
plain-out
could
n't
do
that
even
to
please
her
.

``
You
could
try
.

And
if
I
ever
hear
you
say
'
Mist
Laban
'
again
I
'll
scream
.

And
do
n't
tell
me
you
did
n't
at
church
Sunday
.

I
heard
you
''
!

He
really
had
n't
meant
to
COMMA
he
assured
her
COMMA
but
it
was
plain
to
her
that
the
importance
of
these
small
things
was
lost
on
Mr.
Robards
.

How
strange
it
was
that
he
could
give
her
this
handsome
house
and
carte
blanche
as
to
its
beautiful
furnishings
COMMA
and
fail
her
in
--
spiritual
ways
.

Another
weakness
--
far
more
irritating
than
his
manner
of
speaking
COMMA
which
he
made
only
token
effort
to
change
--
was
his
devotion
to
that
old
horse
of
Tolley
's
.

Her
horse
COMMA
rather
.

But
Mr.
Robards
'
now
COMMA
oh
my
yes
COMMA
indeed
COMMA
yes
!

He
called
her
``
the
Mare
''
much
as
Mrs.
Whipsnade
spoke
of
``
the
Queen
COMMA
God
bless
her
''
.

He
COMMA
with
fifteen
or
twenty
horses
or
mares
or
geldings
or
what-nots
out
there
in
the
barn
COMMA
was
reverent
only
of
``
the
Mare
''
COMMA
``
the
Racin'
Mare
''
COMMA
the
revolting
Gunny
.

For
the
first
few
months
of
their
marriage
she
had
tried
to
be
nice
about
Gunny
COMMA
going
out
with
him
to
watch
this
pearl
without
price
stamp
imperiously
around
in
her
stall
.

And
what
had
happened
?

Gunny
invariably
tried
to
bite
her
.

Nerves
COMMA
Mr.
Robards
said
COMMA
just
a
nip
anyway
.

``
Stand
back
COMMA
Miss
Jen
COMMA
she
's
oneasy
of
your
scarf
''
.

Never
COMMA
``
Quit
that
COMMA
you
sor'l
devil
''
!

Never
concern
for
his
wife
's
nerves
COMMA
or
the
danger
that
the
curled
lip
and
big
teeth
might
mark
their
own
dear
baby
due
in
January
.

She
mus
n't
annoy
Gunny
whose
foal
was
due
then
too
!

Listening
for
hours
to
his
laments
that
the
war
and
``
Mist
Fair
's
''
poverty
afterwards
had
robbed
the
mare
of
many
a
racing
triumph
COMMA
and
to
his
predictions
of
greatness
for
the
procession
of
foals
to
come
COMMA
Jenny
could
look
forward
to
years
of
conflict
with
an
animal
who
disliked
her
intensely
and
showed
it
.

Gunny
symbolized
so
much
that
was
unpleasant
--
Tolley
COMMA
the
indifference
with
which
the
Fairbrothers
and
indeed
the
whole
neighborhood
now
treated
her
and
which
she
would
die
rather
than
acknowledge
to
her
husband
COMMA
his
lack
of
understanding
and
sympathy
in
her
present
condition
COMMA
her
disgusting
swollen
stomach
.

Human
birth
was
no
novelty
to
Mr.
Robards
.

Tillie
was
a
fine
midwife
and
could
get
here
quick
COMMA
he
suggested
.

Jenny
's
aversion
to
having
Dr.
Dunne
COMMA
a
former
admirer
COMMA
seemed
silly
to
him
COMMA
but
he
would
humor
her
COMMA
get
anybody
she
wanted
COMMA
the
best
never
being
too
good
for
her
.

The
chances
were
against
his
being
here
to
humor
her
when
her
time
came
COMMA
she
was
sure
.

He
would
be
in
the
barn
COMMA
or
riding
for
the
veterinarian
!

Night
after
night
he
stayed
with
Gunny
in
the
dead
of
winter
COMMA
rubbing
her
with
quarts
of
expensive
liniment
COMMA
fussing
over
her
bran
mash
as
the
cook
did
over
charlotte
russe
COMMA
tracking
manure
on
the
pretty
new
carpet
when
he
did
come
to
the
house
.

Yet
when
the
dear
baby
came
COMMA
he
had
Tillie
over
here
in
a
jiffy
COMMA
and
was
as
attentive
and
sweet
and
worried
and
happy
when
it
was
all
over
as
any
husband
could
have
been
.

Jenny
wished
now
that
she
had
had
Dr.
Dunne
COMMA
feeling
that
somehow
he
would
n't
have
allowed
the
dear
baby
to
turn
into
triplets
.

There
was
something
not
nice
about
triplets
COMMA
though
their
father
seemed
pleased
COMMA
showing
no
disappointment
that
they
had
n't
been
the
son
he
wanted
COMMA
saying
COMMA
``
You
do
n't
see
triplets
trippin'
down
the
pike
ever'
day
COMMA
Miss
Jen
COMMA
hon
.

Rhyme
'em
up
cute
--

Arcilla
COMMA
Flotilla
''

Edmonia
for
her
mother
COMMA
she
said
firmly
COMMA
Jennifer
COMMA
for
herself
COMMA
and
--

``
Kezziah
COMMA
for
Miss
Kizzie
''
COMMA
he
suggested
.

``
She
was
mighty
good
to
you
past
times
COMMA
an'
this
'll
fetch
her
''
.

Now
she
must
be
thinking
of
a
boy
-
name
COMMA
something
special
.

Just
wait
till
she
saw
the
Mare
's
foal
.

Handsomest
colt
in
all
Kentucky
.

Strong
too
COMMA
up
on
his
legs
when
he
was
an
hour
old
.

What
about
Royal
Robards
?

``
Why
do
n't
you
name
him
Jesus
Christ
!
''

She
burst
into
tears
.

Roy
was
deeply
distressed
.

He
'd
had
no
idea
how
unhappy
his
sweet
peach
had
been
.

Of
course
she
was
n't
herself
right
now
COMMA
but
as
her
strength
came
back
her
spirits
did
n't
seem
to
rise
with
it
.

He
had
a
good
idea
why
not
.

Those
elegant
``
At
Home
''
cards
she
sent
out
COMMA
now
she
could
wear
her
pretty
clothes
again
COMMA
and
had
the
house
all
trimmed
up
COMMA
had
n't
brought
many
callers
in
two
whole
months
.

Doc
Dunne
and
Miss
Sis
had
come
.

So
had
Miss
Shawnee
Rakestraw
COMMA
full
of
criticisms
about
the
changes
here
COMMA
giving
thanks
that
her
dear
old
father
had
gone
to
his
Heavenly
Rest
last
year
COMMA
saying
how
much
she
enjoyed
her
boarding
house
in
town
in
inclement
weather
COMMA
was
looking
forward
to
Quinzaine
Spa
this
summer
.

There
was
an
idea
.

Miss
Kizzie
had
been
right
snippy
ever
since
they
were
married
COMMA
though
you
'd
have
thought
a
namesake
would
have
brought
her
round
.

Oh
COMMA
she
'd
come
to
see
them
once
COMMA
left
silver
teething
rings
for
all
of
the
trips
.

But
when
Miss
Jen
went
over
right
away
to
return
the
call
COMMA
Miss
Kiz
could
n't
have
been
very
cordial
COMMA
for
she
'd
come
back
before
she
hardly
had
time
to
get
there
.

More
and
more
COMMA
these
days
COMMA
she
'd
been
driving
that
pretty
little
mare
that
looked
like
her
COMMA
over
to
Tillie
's
and
Nick
's
--
his
own
old
square
frame
box
on
posts
COMMA
chickens
and
cats
and
pups
under
the
house
COMMA
everybody
friendly
inside
COMMA
making
a
to-do
over
the
babies
dressed
like
dollies
.

Though
he
was
glad
she
got
on
well
with
his
young
folks
COMMA
she
ought
to
be
welcome
at
the
finest
house
in
the
land
COMMA
too
.

It
made
him
pretty
hot
under
the
collar
COMMA
after
the
idea
Miss
Sis
had
given
him
COMMA
to
be
told
by
Miss
Kiz
that
her
holy
spa
was
all
reserved
for
this
summer
and
next
COMMA
if
you
please
COMMA
and
that
much
as
she
regretted
it
COMMA
they
would
be
unable
to
entertain
Mrs.
Robards
and
the
children
.

She
hoped
they
were
well
.

He
did
n't
tell
Miss
Jen
COMMA
but
she
must
have
got
word
from
the
cook
or
nurse
COMMA
who
of
course
knew
those
Quinzaine
nigs
COMMA
and
she
really
took
a
fit
.

If
he
ever
did
such
a
thing
again
she
'd
die
of
shame
.

``
Have
a
party
an'
leave
'em
out
COMMA
hon
''
COMMA
he
suggested
.

``
A
swell
party
COMMA
send
an
invite
to
ever'body
but
them
--
those
folks
you
met
at
the
Galt
House
COMMA
the
ones
I
've
got
to
know
in
this
new
Jockey
Club
affair
COMMA
the
whole
dang
neighborhood
.

We
'll
have
oystchers
--
couple
bar'l
oystchers
'll
fetch
in
a
crowd
any
time
.

I
'll
see
word
gets
round
''
.

``
Do
n't
you
dare
!
''

Miss
Jen
was
funny
that
way
COMMA
funny
that
she
did
n't
seem
to
take
to
his
ideas
and
perk
up
.

He
was
downright
worried
about
her
COMMA
but
there
was
one
more
thing
he
could
try
.

Zion
was
surprised
when
Roy
's
buggy
stopped
beside
her
on
the
pike
one
early
summer
day
as
she
was
walking
home
from
the
country
school
where
she
was
teaching
now
that
Eph
Showers
had
had
a
call
to
preach
in
some
mountain
town
.

Roy
smiled
--
he
did
have
a
nice
smile
--
took
off
his
hat
most
politely
COMMA
told
her
to
hop
in
COMMA
and
he
'd
give
her
a
lift
to
Quinzaine
.

Her
hesitation
was
only
momentary
and
she
hoped
he
did
n't
notice
it
COMMA
as
she
settled
herself
COMMA
asked
quickly
how
Miss
Jenny
and
the
babies
were
getting
on
.

``
See
for
yourself
COMMA
Miss
Zion
.

It
will
n't
take
a
minute
''
.

He
swung
in
through
his
own
wide
gateway
.

``
Them
's
the
purtiest
babes
you
ever
did
see
COMMA
but
Miss
Jen
gets
mighty
lonesome
.

She
'll
relish
the
sight
of
a
friendly
face
.

Miss
Kiz
will
n't
care
your
comin'
COMMA
will
she
''
?

``
Why
of
course
not
''
COMMA
Zion
said
uncomfortably
.

It
was
among
these
that
Hinkle
identified
a
photograph
of
Barco
!

For
it
seems
that
Barco
COMMA
fancying
himself
a
ladies
'
man
(
and
why
not
COMMA
after
seven
marriages
?
)
COMMA
had
listed
himself
for
Mormon
Beard
roles
at
the
instigation
of
his
fourth
murder
victim
who
had
said
:
``
With
your
beard
COMMA
dear
COMMA
you
ought
to
be
in
movies
''
!

Mills
secured
Barco
's
photograph
from
the
gentleman
in
charge
COMMA
rushed
to
the
Hollywood
police
station
to
report
the
theft
COMMA
and
less
than
five
minutes
later
COMMA
detectives
with
his
picture
in
hand
were
on
the
trail
of
Cal
Barco
.

On
their
way
COMMA
they
stopped
at
every
gas
station
along
the
main
boulevards
to
question
the
attendants
.

Finally
COMMA
at
Ye
Olde
Gasse
Filling
Station
on
Avocado
Avenue
COMMA
they
learned
that
their
man
COMMA
having
paused
to
get
oil
for
his
car
COMMA
had
asked
about
the
route
to
San
Diego
.

They
headed
in
that
direction
and
COMMA
at
San
Juan
Capistrano
By-the-Sea
came
upon
Barco
sitting
in
the
quaint
old
Spanish
Mission
Drive-in
COMMA
eating
a
hot
tamale
.

At
the
moment
COMMA
Barco
's
back
was
to
the
road
so
he
did
n't
see
the
detectives
close
in
on
his
convertible
which
COMMA
in
their
quest
for
the
stolen
lap
rug
COMMA
they
proceeded
to
search
.

The
robe
COMMA
however
COMMA
was
missing
COMMA
for
by
that
time
Barco
had
disposed
of
it
at
a
pawnshop
in
Glendale
.

The
detectives
placed
Barco
under
arrest
and
COMMA
without
informing
him
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
COMMA
took
him
back
to
Hollywood
for
questioning
.

Thus
it
was
that
Barco
COMMA
apprehended
for
mere
larceny
COMMA
now
began
to
suspect
that
one
or
another
of
his
murders
had
been
uncovered
.

During
the
return
trip
COMMA
Barco
kept
muttering
to
himself
in
meaningless
phrases
COMMA
such
as
:
``
They
're
under
sand
dunes
They
're
better
off
COMMA
I
tell
you
I
saved
their
souls
''
.

The
detective
COMMA
commenting
on
Barco
's
behavior
COMMA
felt
that
he
merely
belonged
among
the
myriad
citizens
of
our
community
who
are
mentally
unhinged
--
that
he
was
a
more
or
less
harmless
``
nut
''
!

However
while
in
his
cell
awaiting
trial
for
theft
COMMA
Barco
COMMA
in
a
fit
of
apprehension
COMMA
made
an
attempt
to
take
his
own
life
.

The
attempt
had
failed
because
COMMA
when
endeavoring
to
cut
his
wrists
COMMA
this
murderer
of
seven
women
had
fainted
at
the
sight
of
blood
.

The
jail
authorities
--
attaching
no
particular
significance
to
the
episode
--
offered
Barco
whisky
to
revive
him
;
but
the
old
fellow
COMMA
a
lifelong
teetotaler
COMMA
refused
it
COMMA
and
no
more
was
thought
of
the
matter
.

Then
it
was
that
District
Attorney
Welch
entered
the
case
.

A
man
of
vaulting
ambition
COMMA
with
one
eye
on
the
mayorship
of
Los
Angeles
COMMA
nothing
ever
escaped
him
which
might
possibly
lead
to
personal
publicity
.

It
was
reported
to
Welch
's
office
that
a
thief
in
the
city
jail
had
attempted
suicide
.

Welch
wanted
to
know
why
.

No
one
knew
.

Now
Welch
had
a
pet
theory
that
everyone
is
guilty
of
breaking
more
laws
than
he
ever
gets
caught
at
.

The
suicide
attempt
looked
to
him
like
an
opportunity
to
put
his
theory
to
the
test
.

So
he
paid
a
call
on
Barco
in
his
cell
and
began
their
chat
by
stating
bluntly
:
``
Barco
COMMA
we
've
got
the
goods
on
you
!

It
'll
be
a
lot
better
if
you
come
clean
''
.

At
first
Barco
was
evasive
and
shifty
.

But
with
Welch
's
relentless
pursuit
of
the
subject
COMMA
Barco
finally
``
broke
''
and
started
confessing
to
one
murder
after
another
.

By
the
time
Barco
reached
the
count
of
three
COMMA
the
situation
seemed
to
Welch
almost
too
good
to
be
true
.

But
if
true
COMMA
it
was
the
case
of
which
he
had
dreamed
COMMA
the
case
which
would
throw
him
into
headlines
all
over
America
as
the
hero
of
a
great
murder
trial
.

Welch
summoned
jail
officials
to
Barco
's
cell
.

But
to
Welch
's
chagrin
COMMA
the
police
captain
pooh-poohed
Welch
's
credulity
in
Barco
's
confession
.

Barco
was
clearly
a
``
nut
''
.

It
required
strength
COMMA
bravado
COMMA
daring
to
commit
murder
.

``
That
worm
a
murderer
?

Ridiculous
''
!

Then
COMMA
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrest
COMMA
a
glint
of
spirit
lit
Barco
's
eyes
.

His
manhood
had
been
attacked
.

He
stiffened
and
rose
to
his
feet
.

He
'd
show
them
!

``
Is
that
so
''
?
He
queried
.

``
Well
COMMA
for
ten
years
I
've
been
murdering
women
.

I
can
lead
you
to
every
one
of
the
bodies
COMMA
and
there
ai
n't
four
COMMA
nor
five
COMMA
nor
six
of
'em
--
there
's
seven
!
''

The
next
day
the
police
captain
COMMA
in
derision
COMMA
organized
what
he
termed
``
Welch
's
Wild
Goose
Chase
''
.

For
indeed
it
seemed
incredible
that
anyone
could
go
on
committing
murder
for
ten
years
and
not
get
caught
at
it
COMMA
even
in
Hollywood
.

The
searching
party
consisted
of
the
police
captain
COMMA
Welch
COMMA
Barco
COMMA
policemen
with
shovels
COMMA
newspaper
reporters
COMMA
and
cameramen
.

Barco
COMMA
his
state
of
apprehension
gone
COMMA
never
to
return
COMMA
had
assumed
a
matter-of-factness
which
remained
his
principal
attitude
from
that
time
on
.

He
directed
the
cortege
of
autos
to
the
sand
dunes
near
Santa
Monica
.

Stopping
the
cars
at
a
fork
in
the
road
COMMA
he
got
out
COMMA
paced
off
a
certain
distance
to
a
spot
between
two
shrub
-
covered
sand
hills
COMMA
and
indicated
a
location
.

Orders
were
given
to
dig
.

Nothing
was
found
.

Welch
was
worried
.

The
police
captain
chortled
.

The
newspaper
boys
cracked
jokes
and
again
Barco
's
pride
was
aroused
.

With
greater
precision
he
again
paced
off
a
location
COMMA
this
time
a
little
more
to
the
left
.

With
quibs
and
gibes
COMMA
the
policemen
again
started
digging
.

Welch
was
on
edge
.

The
captain
was
remarking
that
it
was
a
nice
day
for
a
picnic
when
finally
one
of
the
shovels
struck
an
object
.

``
There
's
something
here
''
!
Said
the
digger
.

Joking
stopped
and
everyone
gathered
around
.

The
digger
COMMA
thrusting
about
with
his
shovel
COMMA
now
raised
into
view
a
package
crudely
wrapped
in
one
of
the
murderer
's
Hollywood
sport
shirts
.

Although
it
was
a
mere
fragment
of
the
victim
's
remains
COMMA
it
was
enough
.

Welch
was
wild
with
delight
.

His
elation
grew
as
Barco
's
seven
disclosures
brought
to
light
one
reward
after
another
.

Now
did
Welch
truly
become
the
man
of
the
hour
COMMA
and
everything
that
followed
in
the
procedure
of
Justice
was
a
new
triumph
for
him
.

It
went
to
his
head
COMMA
and
his
ambition
increased
.

It
was
apparent
that
Welch
was
in
cahoots
with
Marshall
and
would
use
his
power
as
D.A.
to
drag
every
possible
sensation
into
the
case
.

Every
new
scandal
which
would
provide
more
``
copy
''
for
Marshall
's
pen
would
thus
mean
more
publicity
for
Welch
.

I
knew
that
both
these
cynics
were
waiting
with
impatience
for
the
dramatic
moment
when
Viola
was
called
to
the
stand
.

Once
there
COMMA
the
D.A.
with
devilish
cleverness
would
provide
Marshall
with
headlines
:
``
Viola
's
Multiple
Romances
''
``
Viola
Lake
an
Addict
''
``
Downfall
of
Another
Film
Idol
''
!

It
would
be
fine
publicity
for
the
man
who
was
willing
to
walk
to
the
mayor
's
throne
over
the
broken
reputation
of
a
helpless
girl
!

I
studied
Welch
closely
as
the
trial
progressed
for
any
hint
which
might
give
me
a
lead
as
to
how
he
might
be
thwarted
.

It
was
n't
long
before
I
sensed
that
there
was
something
deeper
than
overvaulting
ambition
back
of
his
desire
for
Viola
's
destruction
.

He
was
bitter
and
resentful
toward
her
COMMA
personally
resentful
.

A
dreadful
fear
entered
my
consciousness
that
perhaps
he
had
entertained
aspirations
toward
Viola
's
favors
--
or
COMMA
even
more
serious
perhaps
COMMA
that
he
had
attained
a
share
of
them
and
had
then
been
superseded
by
some
luckier
chap
.

I
did
not
rest
until
I
had
tracked
the
mystery
down
.

Well
COMMA
here
it
is
.

One
day
over
a
year
before
COMMA
there
had
been
a
cocktail
party
in
an
apartment
of
a
downtown
hotel
.

Viola
had
been
urged
to
attend
COMMA
by
telephone
COMMA
and
not
knowing
the
host
or
the
character
of
the
party
COMMA
she
had
gone
.

She
arrived
late
and
as
she
entered
the
party
COMMA
noted
that
gentlemen
seemed
to
be
in
the
majority
;
the
air
was
thick
with
smoke
COMMA
empty
bottles
were
in
evidence
COMMA
and
several
of
the
guests
were
somewhat
the
worse
for
liquor
.

Naturally
COMMA
Viola
had
no
wish
to
remain
COMMA
but
she
felt
she
could
n't
leave
so
soon
after
her
arrival
COMMA
in
all
politeness
to
her
host
.

And
it
so
happened
that
adjacent
to
a
couch
on
which
she
had
taken
refuge
was
a
small
table
on
which
she
noted
a
vase
of
red
rosebuds
;
while
projecting
from
beneath
the
couch
were
a
pair
of
feet
which
COMMA
as
Fate
would
have
it
COMMA
belonged
to
District
Attorney
Welch
.

As
Viola
sat
there
COMMA
a
playful
impulse
overcame
her
to
remove
the
shoes
and
socks
from
the
unidentified
feet
and
COMMA
as
a
prank
COMMA
insert
rosebuds
between
the
toes
.

A
little
later
the
district
attorney
woke
up
COMMA
emerged
from
under
the
couch
COMMA
looked
at
his
watch
COMMA
and
realized
he
had
an
engagement
that
very
hour
to
address
a
meeting
of
the
Culture
Forum
on
``
The
Civic
Spirit
of
the
Southland
''
COMMA
in
the
Byzantine
room
of
the
hotel
where
his
wife
COMMA
as
president
of
the
forum
COMMA
was
to
preside
.

He
made
his
way
to
his
host
's
bedroom
where
he
carefully
brushed
himself
off
COMMA
neatly
arranged
his
hair
COMMA
and
painstakingly
selected
his
hat
from
the
many
on
the
bed
.

Then
COMMA
noting
neither
the
absence
of
his
footwear
nor
the
presence
of
the
rosebuds
COMMA
he
made
his
way
to
the
Byzantine
room
and
COMMA
with
his
usual
dignity
COMMA
mounted
the
rostrum
.

The
effect
on
the
intellectuals
among
his
audience
may
well
be
imagined
.

The
incident
COMMA
aside
from
reflecting
on
Welch
's
political
career
COMMA
had
all
but
wrecked
his
home
life
.

He
never
rested
until
he
discovered
who
the
culprit
was
COMMA
and
when
he
did
COMMA
he
vowed
vengeance
on
Viola
Lake
if
ever
the
chance
came
his
way
.

And
here
it
was
!

By
such
innocent
actions
are
human
tragedies
sometimes
set
in
motion
.

During
these
first
days
of
the
trial
I
did
n't
have
as
much
time
to
commiserate
with
Viola
as
I
should
have
liked
.

In
the
first
place
COMMA
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
meet
.

We
could
n't
be
seen
together
COMMA
for
the
tongue
of
Scandal
was
ever
ready
to
link
our
names
COMMA
and
the
tongue
of
Scandal
finds
but
one
thing
to
say
of
the
association
of
a
man
with
a
girl
COMMA
no
matter
how
innocent
.

I
could
n't
invite
Viola
to
our
house
COMMA
for
Mother
snobbishly
refused
to
receive
her
.

Now
the
Czarship
had
not
affected
my
own
sense
of
social
values
COMMA
but
Mother
had
attained
a
reflected
glory
through
it
COMMA
which
had
opened
the
doors
of
Los
Angeles
-
Pasadena
Society
to
her
.

There
COMMA
Mother
was
received
by
the
scions
of
aristocratic
lines
which
are
dominated
by
the
Budweisers
(
of
beer
derivation
)
COMMA
the
Chalmers
(
of
underwear
origin
)
COMMA
and
the
Heinzes
(
whose
forbears
founded
a
nationally
famous
trade
in
pickles
)
.

I
hated
being
dragged
into
the
salons
of
these
aristocrats
.

But
Mother
insisted
COMMA
for
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
anyone
remotely
connected
with
the
cinema
is
ever
received
in
their
exclusive
midsts
.

In
fact
COMMA
it
was
not
until
the
King
of
Spain
had
visited
at
Pickfair
that
Mary
and
Doug
were
beckoned
to
cross
the
sacred
barriers
which
separate
Los
Angeles
and
Pasadena
from
the
hoi-polloi
.

Mother
even
went
so
far
as
to
trump
up
for
me
matrimonial
opportunities
with
Pasadena
debs
who
had
been
educated
abroad
COMMA
and
with
those
of
the
more
lenient
Los
Angeles
area
where
a
debutante
was
a
girl
who
had
been
to
high
school
.

But
at
long
last
came
a
time
when
I
broke
away
from
Mother
and
her
society
``
chi-chi
''
in
order
to
spend
a
cosy
evening
with
Viola
and
her
chaperon
at
her
home
.

However
COMMA
such
a
hotbed
of
gossip
had
grown
up
during
the
trial
COMMA
that
every
precaution
had
to
be
taken
to
keep
my
visit
from
being
whispered
to
the
world
COMMA
Society
COMMA
and
even
COMMA
alas
COMMA
to
my
own
mother
.

When
I
arrived
at
Viola
's
I
was
shown
COMMA
to
my
surprise
COMMA
into
the
kitchen
.

Viola
greeted
me
COMMA
in
checked
apron
COMMA
ladle
in
hand
COMMA
and
explained
it
was
the
cook
's
night
out
and
that
she
herself
was
preparing
dinner
.

I
sat
and
watched
proceedings
.

There
was
to
be
roast
chicken
with
dressing
COMMA
giblet
gravy
COMMA
asparagus
COMMA
new
peas
with
a
sprig
of
mint
COMMA
creamed
onions
COMMA
and
mashed
potatoes
--
all
chosen
COMMA
prepared
COMMA
and
cooked
by
Viola
herself
.

I
realized
that
Hamlet
was
faced
with
an
entirely
different
problem
COMMA
but
his
agony
could
have
been
no
greater
.

The
most
that
was
accomplished
was
adding
Mrs.
Beige
's
tray
to
the
dish
pile
COMMA
and
by
means
of
repeated
threats
COMMA
on
an
ascending
scale
COMMA
seeing
that
the
girls
dressed
themselves
COMMA
after
a
fashion
.

I
was
saved
from
making
the
decision
as
the
phone
rang
COMMA
and
the
girls
were
upon
me
instantly
.

Here
's
a
household
hint
:
if
you
ca
n't
find
your
children
COMMA
and
get
tired
of
calling
them
COMMA
pick
up
the
phone
.

No
matter
if
your
children
are
at
the
movies
COMMA
in
school
COMMA
visiting
their
grandmother
COMMA
or
on
a
field
trip
in
some
distant
city
COMMA
they
will
be
upon
you
magically
within
seconds
after
you
pick
up
the
phone
.

Jennie
and
Miranda
twined
themselves
around
me
COMMA
murmuring
endearments
.

Louise
climbed
onto
a
stool
and
clutched
the
hand
with
which
I
was
trying
to
hold
the
phone
COMMA
claiming
my
immediate
attention
on
grounds
of
extreme
emergency
.

Somehow
managing
to
get
out
a
cool
COMMA
poised
COMMA
``
Wo
n't
you
hold
on
a
second
COMMA
please
''
COMMA
I
covered
up
the
mouthpiece
COMMA
and
with
more
warmth
and
less
poise
COMMA
gave
a
quick
lecture
on
crime
and
punishment
COMMA
mostly
the
latter
COMMA
including
Devil
's
Island
and
the
remoter
reaches
of
Siberia
.

I
promised
to
illustrate
the
lecture
COMMA
if
they
so
much
as
breathed
till
after
the
call
was
completed
.

Speaking
into
the
phone
again
and
recognizing
the
caller
COMMA
I
resumed
my
everyday
voice
.

Soon
we
were
deep
in
a
conversation
that
was
interrupted
many
times
by
little
things
like
Jennie
's
holding
her
breath
and
pretending
to
black
out
COMMA
Miranda
's
dumping
the
contents
of
the
sugar
bowl
on
the
table
COMMA
and
various
screeches
COMMA
thuds
COMMA
and
giggles
.

Under
the
circumstances
COMMA
I
had
difficulty
keeping
up
with
the
conversation
on
the
phone
COMMA
but
when
I
hung
up
I
was
reasonably
certain
that
Francesca
had
wanted
to
remind
me
of
our
town
meeting
the
next
evening
COMMA
and
how
important
it
was
that
Hank
and
I
be
there
.

I
discovered
that
the
girls
had
shrewdly
vacated
the
kitchen
COMMA
and
were
playing
quietly
in
the
living
room
.

It
seemed
that
I
would
be
the
gainer
if
I
accepted
the
peace
and
quiet
COMMA
instead
of
carrying
out
my
threats
.

Resolving
to
get
something
done
COMMA
I
started
in
on
the
dishes
.

No
.

I
'm
not
saying
it
right
.

What
I
meant
to
say
was
that
I
started
to
start
in
on
the
dishes
by
gathering
them
all
together
in
the
kitchen
sink
.

They
looked
so
formidable
COMMA
however
COMMA
so
demanding
COMMA
that
I
found
myself
staring
at
them
in
dismay
and
starting
to
woolgather
again
COMMA
this
time
about
Francesca
and
her
husband
.

How
about
them
COMMA
I
thought
.

Francesca
and
Herbert
were
among
the
few
people
we
knew
in
Catatonia
.

We
did
n't
even
know
them
till
about
a
month
after
we
moved
--
at
that
time
COMMA
they
had
called
on
us
COMMA
after
I
met
Fran
at
a
PTA
meeting
COMMA
and
had
taken
us
in
hand
socially
.

They
had
been
kind
to
us
and
we
were
indebted
to
them
for
one
or
two
pleasant
dinners
COMMA
and
for
information
as
to
where
to
shop
COMMA
which
dentist
COMMA
doctor
COMMA
plumber
COMMA
and
sitter
to
call
(
not
that
there
was
much
of
a
choice
COMMA
since
Catatonia
was
just
a
village
;
the
yellow
pages
of
the
telephone
book
were
amazingly
thin
)
.

They
were
``
personalities
''
.

Herb
COMMA
an
expert
on
narrow
ties
COMMA
thin
lapels
COMMA
and
swatches
COMMA
was
men
's
fashion
editor
of
Parvenu
COMMA
the
weekly
magazine
with
the
tremendous
circulation
.

Fran
and
he
had
met
about
two
years
after
she
had
arrived
in
Manhattan
from
Nebraska
COMMA
or
was
it
Wyoming
?

She
was
the
daughter
and
sole
heiress
of
either
a
cattle
baron
or
an
oil
millionaire
and
COMMA
having
arrived
in
New
York
with
a
big
bank
roll
COMMA
became
a
dabbler
in
various
fields
.

She
patronized
Greenwich
Village
artists
for
awhile
COMMA
then
put
some
money
into
a
Broadway
show
which
was
successful
(
terrible
COMMA
but
successful
)
.

It
was
during
her
``
writing
''
period
that
she
and
Herb
met
and
decided
that
they
were
in
love
.

They
were
married
at
a
lavish
ceremony
which
was
duly
recorded
in
Parvenu
and
all
other
magazines
and
newspapers
COMMA
and
then
they
honeymooned
in
Bermuda
.

No
COMMA
not
Bermuda
.

Bermuda
was
not
in
style
that
year
.

They
had
honeymooned
in
Rome
;
everyone
was
very
high
on
Rome
that
year
.

They
had
bought
their
house
in
Catatonia
after
investigating
all
the
regions
of
suburbia
surrounding
New
York
;
they
had
chosen
Catatonia
because
of
its
reputation
for
excellent
schools
COMMA
beaches
COMMA
and
abundance
of
names
.

``
You
are
bound
to
get
involved
with
people
when
you
have
children
''
COMMA
Fran
had
told
me
at
our
first
meeting
COMMA
``
so
it
is
good
to
know
that
those
with
whom
you
get
involved
are
not
just
dreary
little
housewives
and
dull
husbands
COMMA
but
People
Who
Do
Things
''
.

I
admired
their
easy
way
of
doing
things
but
I
could
n't
escape
an
uneasiness
at
their
way
of
always
doing
the
right
things
.

Their
house
was
a
centuries
-
old
Colonial
which
they
had
had
restored
(
guided
by
an
eminent
architect
)
and
updated
COMMA
and
added
on
to
.

It
had
a
gourmet
's
corner
(
instead
of
a
kitchen
)
COMMA
a
breakfast
room
COMMA
a
luncheon
room
COMMA
a
dining
room
COMMA
a
sitting
room
COMMA
a
room
for
standing
up
COMMA
a
party
room
COMMA
dressing
rooms
for
everybody
COMMA
even
a
room
for
mud
.

It
was
all
set
up
so
there
would
be
no
dust
anywhere
and
so
that
their
children
would
color
in
the
coloring
room
COMMA
paint
in
the
painting
room
COMMA
play
with
blocks
in
the
block
house
COMMA
and
do
all
the
other
things
in
the
proper
rooms
at
exactly
the
right
time
.

Their
two
boys
were
``
well
adjusted
''
and
COMMA
like
their
parents
COMMA
always
did
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
and
damn
the
consequences
.

Francesca
and
Herbert
considered
themselves
violently
nonconformist
and
showed
the
world
they
were
by
filling
their
Colonial
house
with
contemporary
furniture
and
paintings
and
other
art
objects
(
expensive
COMMA
but
not
necessarily
valuable
COMMA
contemporary
things
)
.

Fran
flaunted
her
independence
by
rebelling
against
the
Catatonia
uniform
of
Bermuda
shorts
and
knee
-
length
socks
by
wearing
Bermuda
shorts
and
knee
-
length
socks
in
colors
;
bright
pinks
and
plaids
and
vivid
stripes
.

Sometimes
she
even
wore
the
uniform
in
solid
COMMA
unrelieved
black
COMMA
and
with
her
blonde
hair
cut
so
closely
COMMA
wearing
this
uniform
COMMA
she
strongly
resembled
a
member
of
the
SS.
.

No
one
could
dislike
them
COMMA
I
thought
.

Sometimes
COMMA
though
COMMA
they
did
not
seem
quite
human
.

It
seemed
COMMA
indeed
COMMA
that
their
house
was
not
so
much
a
home
COMMA
but
rather
a
perfect
stage
set
COMMA
and
that
they
were
actors
who
had
been
handed
fat
roles
in
a
successful
play
COMMA
and
had
talent
enough
to
fill
the
roles
competently
COMMA
with
nice
understatement
.

Practically
the
only
enthusiasm
they
showed
was
when
they
were
discussing
``
names
''
;
even
brand
names
.

You
should
hear
the
reverence
in
Fran
's
voice
when
she
said
``
Baccarat
''
or
``
Steuben
''
or
``
Madame
Alexander
''
.

She
always
let
it
be
known
that
there
was
wine
in
the
pot
roast
or
that
the
chicken
had
been
marinated
in
brandy
COMMA
and
that
Koussevitzky
's
second
cousin
was
an
intimate
of
theirs
.

I
would
n't
have
wasted
time
puzzling
over
this
couple
were
it
not
for
my
fear
that
all
the
other
inhabitants
of
Catatonia
were
equally
unreal
.

I
could
n't
feel
at
home
among
them
.

Besides
Francesca
COMMA
there
was
Blanche
.

Francesca
was
pleasant
and
charming
COMMA
but
Blanche
was
sweet
.

Yes
COMMA
Blanche
was
very
COMMA
very
sweet
--
being
in
her
company
was
like
being
drowned
in
warm
COMMA
melted
marshmallows
.

I
had
once
been
a
witness
when
Blanche
had
smiled
and
said
with
only
minimum
ruefulness
COMMA
``
Oh
COMMA
my
souffle
has
collapsed
''
.

Anyone
knows
how
a
real
COMMA
red-blooded
woman
would
react
to
such
a
catastrophe
!

If
Blanche
had
been
honest
COMMA
she
would
have
yelled
COMMA
slammed
at
least
a
couple
of
doors
COMMA
and
thrown
a
few
little
COMMA
valueless
things
.

But
dear
me
COMMA
no
;
not
Blanche
.

After
five
minutes
with
Blanche
COMMA
one
might
welcome
the
astringency
of
Grazie
COMMA
who
was
a
sort
of
Gwen
Cafritz
to
Francesca
's
Perle
Mesta
.

Francesca
and
Grazie
were
habitual
committee
chairmen
and
they
usually
managed
to
be
elected
co-chairmen
COMMA
equal
bosses
COMMA
of
whatever
PTA
or
civic
project
was
being
launched
.

They
were
inseparable
COMMA
not
because
they
were
fond
of
each
other
COMMA
but
because
they
wanted
to
keep
an
eye
on
each
other
COMMA
as
they
were
keen
rivals
for
social
leadership
.

Grazie
was
mean
:
quietly
mean
COMMA
and
bitterly
COMMA
unfunnily
sarcastic
.

She
it
was
who
had
looked
to
see
if
I
was
wearing
shoes
upon
learning
that
I
could
n't
drive
.

Grazie
had
a
small
COMMA
slick
head
and
her
hair
and
skin
were
the
color
of
golden
toast
.

She
lived
in
an
ultra-modern
house
whose
decoration
COMMA
appointments
COMMA
paint
COMMA
and
even
pets
were
chosen
to
complement
her
coloring
;
the
pets
were
a
couple
of
Siamese
cats
.

Her
uniform
was
of
rich
COMMA
raw
silk
COMMA
in
a
shade
which
matched
her
hair
COMMA
skin
COMMA
housepaint
COMMA
and
cats
COMMA
and
since
she
was
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
shapeless
COMMA
she
rather
resembled
a
frozen
fish
stick
.

The
husbands
of
these
women
and
others
I
had
met
in
Catatonia
were
distinguished
only
in
that
they
were
COMMA
to
me
at
least
COMMA
indistinguishable
.

I
could
n't
tell
one
from
the
other
.

Like
Herbert
COMMA
they
were
all
in
communications
:
radio
COMMA
television
COMMA
magazines
COMMA
and
advertising
.

One
or
two
were
writers
of
books
;
all
were
fellows
of
finite
charm
.

Each
had
developed
a
hair
-
trigger
chuckle
and
the
habit
of
saying
``
zounds
''
!
In
deference
to
country
-
squirehood
.

I
never
thought
I
'd
live
to
hear
people
chuckle
and
say
``
zounds
''
!
In
real
life
.

I
would
n't
have
missed
it
for
anything
.

They
were
``
sincere
''
--
men
of
the
too-hearty
handclasp
and
the
urgent
smile
.

These
boys
acknowledged
an
introduction
to
anybody
by
gently
pressing
one
of
his
hands
in
both
of
theirs
COMMA
while
they
gazed
COMMA
misty-eyed
with
care
COMMA
into
the
eyes
of
the
person
they
were
meeting
.

Could
such
unadulterated
love
COMMA
for
a
total
stranger
COMMA
be
credited
?

They
were
always
leaping
to
light
cigarettes
COMMA
open
car
doors
COMMA
fill
plates
or
glasses
COMMA
and
I
mistrusted
the
whole
lot
of
them
to
the
same
degree
that
I
mistrusted
bake
shops
that
called
themselves
``
Sanitary
Bake
Shops
''
.

``
O
!
Pioneers
!
''
I
thought
COMMA
and
wondered
what
kind
of
homesteads
such
odd
pioneers
would
establish
in
this
suburban
frontier
;
pioneers
who
looked
like
off-duty
gardeners
even
at
parent
-
teacher
conferences
and
who
never
called
the
school
principal
``
Mister
''
.

I
sighed
COMMA
thinking
that
among
other
things
COMMA
people
here
seemed
to
be
those
who
would
have
to
cut
down
if
they
earned
less
than
$
85COMMA000
yearly
;
people
who
would
give
their
teeth
for
a
chance
to
get
on
``
Person
to
Person
''
;
people
who
thought
it
was
nice
to
be
important
COMMA
but
not
important
to
be
nice
;
who
were
more
ingratiating
than
gracious
COMMA
more
personalities
than
persons
.

In
my
estimation
COMMA
they
were
people
who
read
Daphne
du
Maurier
COMMA
and
discussed
Kafka
;
well
COMMA
not
discussed
him
exactly
COMMA
but
said
COMMA
``
Kafka
''
!
Reverently
and
raised
their
eyes
COMMA
as
if
they
were
at
a
loss
to
describe
how
they
felt
about
Kafka
COMMA
which
they
were
COMMA
because
they
had
no
opinions
about
Kafka
COMMA
not
having
read
Kafka
.

They
were
COMMA
I
felt
COMMA
people
invariably
trying
to
prove
not
who
COMMA
but
what
they
were
COMMA
and
trying
to
determine
what
COMMA
not
who
COMMA
others
were
.

Becoming
aware
that
it
was
nearly
lunchtime
COMMA
I
brought
myself
back
to
the
tasks
at
hand
.

I
made
plans
for
the
afternoon
--
doing
the
breakfast
and
luncheon
dishes
all
at
once
COMMA
making
the
beds
COMMA
and
then
maybe
painting
the
kitchen
.

Then
COMMA
I
remembered
that
the
girls
had
had
a
banana
for
dessert
every
day
for
the
last
week
.

``
Bananas
''
!
Jennie
had
shouted
each
time
.

``
They
're
not
dessert
!

They
're
not
even
food
.

They
're
just
something
you
're
supposed
to
put
on
cereal
for
breakfast
''
.

I
dug
around
and
found
a
mix
COMMA
and
was
able
to
surprise
them
with
a
devil
's
-
food
cake
with
chocolate
icing
.

(
Sometimes
I
think
you
need
only
one
rule
for
cooking
:
if
you
ca
n't
put
garlic
in
it
COMMA
put
chocolate
in
it
.
)

The
cake
was
received
in
a
stunned
silence
that
was
evidence
in
itself
of
the
dearth
of
taste
thrills
Mama
had
been
providing
.

Then
Jennie
closed
her
eyes
COMMA
stretched
forth
her
arms
COMMA
and
said
:
``
Take
my
hand
COMMA
Louise
;
I
'm
a
stranger
in
paradise
''
.

Needless
to
say
COMMA
I
was
furious
at
this
unparalleled
intrusion
upon
free
enterprise
.

How
dared
they
demand
to
``
snoop
''
in
private
financial
records
COMMA
disbursements
COMMA
confidential
contracts
and
agreements
?

``
It
is
as
though
''
COMMA
I
said
on
the
historic
three
-
hour
COMMA
coast
-
to
-
coast
radio
broadcast
which
I
bought
(
following
Father
Coughlin
and
pre-empting
the
Eddie
Cantor
COMMA
Manhattan
Merry-go-round
and
Major
Bowes
shows
)
``
That
Man
in
the
White
House
COMMA
like
some
despot
of
yore
COMMA
insisted
on
reading
my
diary
COMMA
raiding
my
larder
and
ransacking
my
lingerie
!
''

My
impassioned
plea
for
civil
rights
created
a
landslide
of
correspondence
and
one
sponsor
even
asked
me
to
consider
replacing
the
Eddie
Cantor
comedy
hour
on
a
permanent
basis
.

But
what
quarter
could
a
poor
defenseless
woman
expect
from
a
dictator
who
would
even
make
so
bold
as
to
close
all
of
the
banks
in
our
great
nation
?

The
savage
barbarian
hordes
of
red
Russian
Communism
descended
on
the
Athens
that
was
mighty
Metronome
COMMA
sacking
and
despoiling
with
their
Bolshevistic
battle
cry
of
``
Soak
the
rich
'
!

After
an
unspeakable
siege
COMMA
lasting
the
better
part
of
two
months
COMMA
it
was
announced
that
the
studio
``
owed
''
the
government
a
tax
debt
in
excess
of
eight
million
dollars
while
I
COMMA
who
had
always
remained
aloof
from
such
iniquitous
practices
as
paying
taxes
on
the
salary
I
had
earned
and
the
little
I
legally
inherited
as
Morris
'
helpless
relict
COMMA
was
``
stung
''
with
a
personal
bill
of
such
astronomical
proportions
as
to
``
wipe
out
''
all
but
a
fraction
of
my
poor
COMMA
hard-come-by
savings
.

I
was
also
publicly
reprimanded
COMMA
dragged
through
the
mud
by
the
radical
press
and
made
a
figure
of
fun
by
such
leftist
publications
as
The
New
Republic
COMMA
The
New
Yorker
COMMA
Time
and
The
Christian
Science
Monitor
.

It
was
then
that
I
availed
myself
of
the
rights
of
a
citizen
and
declared
the
income
tax
unconstitutional
.

The
litigation
was
costly
and
seemingly
endless
.

I
fought
like
a
tigress
but
by
the
time
I
appealed
my
case
to
the
Supreme
Court
(
1937
)
COMMA
Mr.
Roosevelt
and
his
``
henchmen
''
had
done
their
``
dirty
work
''
all
too
well
COMMA
even
going
so
far
as
to
attempt
to
``
pack
''
the
highest
tribunal
in
the
land
in
order
to
defeat
little
me
.

Presidential
coercion
had
succeeded
not
only
in
poisoning
the
courtiers
COMMA
``
toadies
''
and
sycophants
of
the
``
bench
''
against
me
COMMA
but
it
had
been
so
far
-
reaching
as
to
discourage
any
lawyer
in
the
nation
from
representing
me
!

I
was
ready
COMMA
like
Portia
COMMA
to
present
my
own
brief
.

But
the
Supreme
Court
would
n't
even
hear
my
case
!

My
plea
was
unanimously
voted
down
and
``
thrown
out
''
.

Again
COMMA
my
name
was
on
all
the
front
pages
.

I
was
COMMA
it
seemed
COMMA
persona
non
grata
in
every
quarter
COMMA
but
not
entirely
without
a
staunch
following
of
noted
political
thinkers
and
students
of
jurisprudence
.

As
Charles
Evans
Hughes
said
COMMA
``
Miss
Poitrine
's
limitations
as
an
actress
are
exceeded
only
by
her
logic
as
a
litigant
''
.

Albert
Einstein
was
quoted
as
saying
:
``
The
workings
of
the
woman
's
mind
amaze
me
''
.

Henry
Ford
spoke
of
me
as
``
utterly
astounding
''
.

Heywood
Broun
wrote
:
``
Belle
Poitrine
is
the
most
original
thinker
since
Caligula
''
COMMA
and
even
F.D.R.
had
to
concede
that
``
if
the
rest
of
this
nation
showed
the
foresight
and
patriotism
of
Miss
Poitrine
COMMA
America
would
rapidly
resemble
ancient
Babylon
and
Nineveh
''
.

Not
only
were
the
court
costs
prohibitive
COMMA
but
I
was
subjected
to
crippling
fines
COMMA
in
addition
to
usurious
interest
on
the
unpaid
``
debts
''
which
the
government
claimed
that
Metronome
and
I
owed
--
a
severe
financial
blow
.

Nor
COMMA
as
Manny
said
COMMA
had
the
notoriety
done
my
career
``
any
good
''
.

My
enemies
were
only
too
anxious
to
level
against
me
such
charges
as
``
reactionary
''
COMMA
``
robber
baroness
''
COMMA
and
even
``
traitor
''
!

Traitor
indeed
!

I
point
now
with
pride
to
the
fact
that
COMMA
long
ere
the
Committee
on
Un-American
Activities
COMMA
the
Minute
Women
COMMA
the
Economic
Council
and
other
such
notable
``
watchdog
''
organizations
were
so
much
as
heard
of
COMMA
I
was
Hollywood
's
leading
bulwark
against
communism
COMMA
fighting
single-handedly
``
creeping
socialism
''
against
such
insuperable
odds
as
the
Fascio-Communist
troops
of
the
NRA
COMMA
PWA
COMMA
WPA
COMMA
CCC
and
an
army
of
more
than
twenty-two
million
mercenaries
whom
F.D.R.
employed
secretly
COMMA
through
the
transparent
ruse
of
regular
``
relief
''
checks
.

Needless
to
say
COMMA
my
art
suffered
drastically
during
this
turbulent
period
.

Could
it
do
otherwise
?

Even
though
I
have
always
had
a
genius
for
``
throwing
myself
''
into
every
role
and
``
playing
it
for
all
it
's
worth
''
COMMA
no
actress
can
be
expected
to
do
her
best
work
when
her
fortune
COMMA
her
reputation
COMMA
her
livelihood
COMMA
her
home
and
her
nation
itself
are
all
imperilled
.

Such
sweeping
distractions
are
hardly
conducive
to
``
Oscar
''
winning
performances
.

I
tried
my
hardest
COMMA
with
little
help
COMMA
may
I
say
COMMA
from
my
husband
and
leading
man
COMMA
but
somehow
the
outside
pressures
were
too
severe
.

Having
(
through
my
unflagging
effort
and
devotion
)
achieved
stardom
COMMA
a
fortune
and
a
world
-
renowned
wife
at
an
age
when
most
young
men
are
casting
their
first
vote
COMMA
Letch
proceeded
to
neglect
them
all
.

Never
a
``
quick
study
''
COMMA
he
now
made
no
attempt
to
learn
his
``
lines
''
and
many
a
mile
of
film
was
wasted
COMMA
many
a
scene
--
sometimes
involving
as
many
as
a
thousand
fellow
thespians
--
was
taken
thirty
COMMA
forty
COMMA
fifty
times
because
Miss
Poitrine
's
co-star
and
``
helpmate
''
had
never
learned
his
part
.

Each
time
Letch
``
went
up
''
in
his
``
lines
''
COMMA
I
was
the
one
to
be
patient
COMMA
helpful
and
apologetic
while
he
indulged
in
outbursts
of
temperament
COMMA
profanity
and
abuse
COMMA
blaming
others
COMMA
going
into
``
sulks
''
and
COMMA
on
more
occasions
than
I
care
to
count
COMMA
storming
off
the
``
set
''
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.

As
for
his
finances
COMMA
I
was
never
privileged
to
know
exactly
how
much
money
Letch
had
``
salted
away
''
.

It
was
I
who
paid
for
our
little
home
COMMA
the
food
COMMA
the
liquor
COMMA
the
servants
--
even
Letch
's
bills
at
his
tailor
and
the
Los
Angeles
Athletic
Club
.

Never
once
did
he
buy
me
a
single
gift
and
for
our
third
anniversary
he
gave
me
a
dislocated
jaw
.

(
But
that
is
another
story
.
)

As
for
his
private
monies
COMMA
they
were
rapidly
dissipated
in
drinking
COMMA
gaming
and
carousing
.

More
than
once
I
was
confronted
by
professional
gamblers
COMMA
``
bookies
''
COMMA
loan
``
sharks
''
COMMA
gangsters
COMMA
``
thugs
''
and
``
finger
men
''
--
people
of
a
class
I
did
not
even
know
existed
--
to
repay
my
husband
's
staggering
losses
COMMA
``
or
else
''

I
shuddered
to
think
that
someone
so
dear
to
me
could
even
associate
with
such
a
sinister
milieu
.

And
at
three
different
times
during
our
turbulent
marriage
strange
girls
COMMA
with
the
commonest
of
accents
COMMA
telephoned
to
announce
to
me
that
Letch
had
sired
their
unborn
children
!

Having
the
deepest
of
maternal
instincts
COMMA
my
heart
fairly
bled
when
I
thought
of
the
darling
pink
and
white
``
bundles
from
heaven
''
I
would
have
proudly
given
my
husband
.

``
Ah
COMMA
you
're
too
old
''
COMMA
was
invariably
his
ungallant
and
untrue
retort
whenever
I
suggested
``
starting
a
family
''
.

Letch
had
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
he
did
not
care
for
the
company
of
my
own
precious
daughter
.

I
now
felt
it
wiser
to
keep
Baby-dear
in
school
and
--
during
the
summers
--
at
a
camp
run
by
the
Society
of
Friends
all
year
around
.

Her
presence
only
made
Letch
more
distant
and
irritable
and
COMMA
in
the
hurry
of
buying
Chateau
Belletch
COMMA
I
had
neglected
to
consider
a
room
for
Baby-dear
COMMA
so
there
was
no
place
to
put
her
COMMA
anyhow
.

(
I
sometimes
feel
that
God
COMMA
in
His
infinite
wisdom
COMMA
wants
us
to
have
these
inexplicable
little
lapses
of
memory
.

It
almost
always
works
out
for
the
best
.
)

Yet
I
adored
this
man
COMMA
Letch
Feeley
COMMA
why
COMMA
I
can
not
say
.

With
faint
heart
and
a
brave
smile
COMMA
I
endured
his
long
absences
from
Chateau
Belletch
COMMA
his
coldness
COMMA
his
indifference
COMMA
his
slights
and
his
abuse
.

The
times
I
can
recall
when
I
was
publicly
humiliated
by
him
--
lovely
dinner
parties
in
our
Trianon
Suite
where
the
collation
was
postponed
and
postponed
and
postponed
COMMA
only
to
be
served
dry
and
overcooked
at
a
table
where
the
host
's
chair
was
vacant
;
a
``
splash
party
''
at
the
new
pool
COMMA
which
I
had
built
in
the
hope
of
keeping
Letch
away
from
public
beaches
COMMA
when
Letch
and
a
certain
Aquacutie
stayed
underwater
together
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
;
a
lovely
Epiphany
party
at
Errol
Flynn
's
COMMA
on
which
sacred
occasion
Letch
stole
away
with
an
unknown
``
starlet
''
COMMA
leaving
me
``
high
and
dry
''
to
get
home
as
best
I
could
.

These
are
but
a
sampling
of
the
insults
I
endured
.

As
Mrs.
Letch
Feeley
COMMA
was
it
any
wonder
that
I
COMMA
once
the
social
arbiter
of
Filmdom
COMMA
was
excluded
from
the
smart
entertainments
given
by
the
Astaires
COMMA
the
Coopers
COMMA
the
Gables
COMMA
the
Colmans
COMMA
the
Rathbones
COMMA
the
Taylors
COMMA
the
Thalbergs
and
such
devout
COMMA
closely
knit
families
as
the
Barrymores
and
the
Crosbys
?

As
Letch
's
antisocial
conduct
increased
COMMA
our
invitations
decreased
and
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
whenever
I
played
hostess
at
a
fashionable
``
screenland
''
gathering
.

Between
1935
and
1939
Letch
and
I
made
ten
films
together
COMMA
each
less
successful
COMMA
both
artistically
and
commercially
COMMA
than
the
one
before
it
.

Our
last
joint
venture
COMMA
Sainted
Lady
COMMA
a
deeply
religious
film
based
on
the
life
of
Mother
Cabrini
COMMA
and
timed
so
that
its
release
date
would
coincide
with
the
beatification
of
America
's
first
saint
in
November
COMMA
1938
COMMA
was
a
fiasco
from
start
to
finish
.

As
I
was
playing
Mother
Cabrini
COMMA
the
picture
was
actually
``
all
mine
''
COMMA
with
nearly
every
scene
built
around
me
.

But
in
order
to
keep
Letch
in
the
public
eye
and
out
of
trouble
COMMA
I
wrote
in
a
part
especially
for
him
--
that
of
a
dashing
ruffian
who
``
sees
the
light
''
and
is
saved
by
the
inspiring
example
of
Mother
Cabrini
.

And
did
he
appreciate
my
efforts
on
his
behalf
?

Did
he
trouble
to
memorize
the
very
small
part
which
I
had
``
tailor-made
''
to
his
specifications
COMMA
a
role
eventually
cut
down
to
three
short
speeches
?

Did
he
show
the
rest
of
the
cast
--
numbering
four
thousand
--
the
consideration
of
arriving
at
the
studio
punctually
--
or
even
at
all
?

He
did
not
!

The
``
shooting
''
went
on
for
eight
months
!

Most
of
our
working
days
were
spent
on
the
telephone
calling
``
bookies
''
COMMA
illegal
gambling
dens
COMMA
a
certain
``
residential
club
for
young
actresses
''
COMMA
more
than
a
hundred
different
bars
or
the
steam
room
of
the
athletic
club
.

Whenever
he
deigned
to
appear
at
the
studio
he
was
``
hung
over
''
COMMA
uncooperative
COMMA
rude
and
insulting
.

He
made
many
tasteless
COMMA
irreverent
and
unfunny
remarks
COMMA
not
only
about
me
in
the
title
role
COMMA
but
about
religion
in
general
.

By
the
time
the
film
was
released
we
were
three
million
dollars
over-spent
COMMA
war
was
imminent
and
the
public
apparently
had
forgotten
all
about
Mother
Cabrini
.

Thanks
to
Letch
Feeley
and
the
terrible
strain
he
imposed
on
me
COMMA
the
notices
were
few
and
unfavorable
.

Only
George
Santayana
seemed
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
film
when
he
wrote
:
``
Miss
Poitrine
has
perpetrated
the
most
eloquent
argument
for
the
Protestant
faith
yet
unleashed
by
Hollywood
''
.

But
it
was
small
consolation
.

In
a
rare
fit
of
anger
and
spite
COMMA
I
``
farmed
out
''
my
own
husband
to
a
small
and
most
undistinguished
studio
to
make
one
picture
as
a
form
of
punishment
.

(
An
actor
must
have
discipline
.
)

The
film
was
called
The
Diet
of
Worms
COMMA
which
I
felt
was
just
what
Letch
deserved
.

It
turned
out
to
be
a
life
of
Martin
Luther
COMMA
of
all
things
!

It
was
a
disaster
!

In
clothes
COMMA
Letch
simply
did
not
project
.

He
was
laughed
off
the
screen
.

At
the
same
time
COMMA
however
COMMA
I
availed
myself
of
the
services
of
that
great
English
actor
and
master
of
make-up
COMMA
Sir
Gauntley
Pratt
COMMA
to
do
a
``
quickie
''
called
The
Mystery
of
the
Mad
Marquess
COMMA
in
which
I
played
a
young
American
girl
who
inherits
a
haunted
castle
on
the
English
moors
which
is
filled
with
secret
passages
and
sliding
panels
and
COMMA
unbeknownst
to
anyone
COMMA
is
still
occupied
by
an
eccentric
maniac
.

It
was
a
``
potboiler
''
made
on
a
``
shoestring
''
and
not
the
sort
of
film
I
like
COMMA
as
all
I
had
to
do
was
look
blank
and
scream
a
great
deal
.

My
heart
was
not
in
it
COMMA
but
COMMA
oddly
enough
COMMA
it
remains
the
most
financially
successful
picture
of
my
career
.

(
I
watched
it
on
television
late
one
night
last
week
and
it
``
stands
up
''
remarkably
well
COMMA
even
twenty
years
later
.
)

Letch
had
returned
from
his
debacle
unrepentant
and
more
badly
behaved
than
before
.

I
really
loved
that
boy
COMMA
and
COMMA
in
a
feverish
attempt
to
preserve
our
marriage
and
to
try
to
revive
the
wonderful
COMMA
wonderful
person
Letch
had
once
been
COMMA
I
took
my
troubles
to
Momma
COMMA
hoping
that
her
earthy
advice
would
help
me
.

``
If
I
could
only
think
of
something
at
the
studio
COMMA
near
me
COMMA
to
absorb
his
boundless
energy
''
COMMA
I
said
.

``
What
is
Letch
interested
in
''
?

``
Bookies
COMMA
booze
and
babes
''
COMMA
Momma
said
bluntly
.

Her
reply
stung
me
COMMA
but
this
was
too
important
to
let
my
hurt
make
any
difference
.

``
I
ca
n't
turn
the
studio
into
a
gambling
hell
or
a
saloon
''
COMMA
I
said
.

A
Brief
History

Prehistoric
man
in
Asia
Minor
(
now
modern
Turkey
)
or
Greece
could
look
out
across
the
Aegean
toward
the
horizon
and
see
the
faint
silhouette
of
land
.

Their
curiosity
pushed
them
to
build
vessels
that
were
strong
enough
to
ford
the
open
seas
and
reach
these
islands
COMMA
marking
the
start
of
the
long
legacy
of
Mediterranean
seafaring
.

Around
7000
b.
c.
COMMA
the
Phoenicians
set
out
from
what
is
now
Iran
to
explore
their
surroundings
.

They
eventually
reached
the
islands
COMMA
and
founded
colonies
on
the
islands
in
the
northernmost
part
of
the
Aegean
Sea
.

An
important
early
material
COMMA
obsidian
COMMA
was
discovered
on
the
island
of
Milos
.

Obsidian
is
a
hard
COMMA
vitreous
volcanic
rock
COMMA
which
could
be
fashioned
into
tools
for
cutting
and
stabbing
.

The
high
quality
of
the
seam
on
Milos
ensured
that
the
area
remained
popular
with
early
travelers
.

The
basic
elements
of
life
in
the
Aegean
began
to
come
together
as
early
as
5000
b.
c.
COMMA
and
were
already
in
place
by
the
late
Bronze
Age
(
c.
2700
b.
c.
)
.

The
major
changes
were
not
to
daily
tasks
and
routines
COMMA
but
to
the
political
power
base
COMMA
which
changed
regularly
and
not
necessarily
peacefully
throughout
the
ages
.

Cycladic
Culture

At
around
3500
b.
c.
COMMA
a
sophisticated
culture
evolved
in
the
Cyclades
islands
.

The
distinctive
COMMA
sculpted
marble
figures
of
the
era
are
now
being
reproduced
in
vast
quantities
as
souvenirs
.

You
will
find
original
examples
in
the
archaeological
museums
throughout
the
Cyclades
COMMA
although
one
of
the
earliest
examples
is
in
the
museum
on
Paros
.

The
people
farmed
and
fished
;

on
the
dawning
of
the
Bronze
Age
in
2700
b.
c.
COMMA
they
began
to
work
with
metals
.

The
Cycladic
culture
was
influenced
by
societies
in
the
east
COMMA
importing
the
pottery
wheel
from
Mesopotamia
.

They
also
continued
to
trade
in
obsidian
and
the
local
marble
.

The
Minoans
and
the
Myceneans

Farther
south
in
Crete
COMMA
the
Minoan
culture
developed
after
2000
b.
c.
into
the
most
significant
of
its
age
COMMA
spreading
its
influence
throughout
the
region
by
trade
and
diplomacy
.

Santorini
(
Thira
)
COMMA
the
next
major
island
north
COMMA
was
heavily
influenced
by
Crete
COMMA
and
the
settlements
of
Thira
and
Akrotiri
thrived
at
this
time
.

The
magnificent
frescoes
and
mosaics
found
at
Akrotiri
are
in
Athens
at
present
COMMA
but
the
remains
of
the
buildings
at
the
site
provide
ample
evidence
of
the
sophistication
of
the
culture
here
.

Around
1500
b.
c.
COMMA
a
massive
volcanic
eruption
at
Santorini
destroyed
not
only
Akrotiri
—
under
feet
of
ash
and
pumice
—
but
the
whole
Minoan
civilization
.

Massive
tidal
waves
swept
over
Crete
COMMA
and
other
parts
of
the
Mediterranean
COMMA
smashing
buildings
and
drowning
many
thousands
of
people
.

In
the
wake
of
this
tremendous
natural
upheaval
COMMA
the
Aegean
Islands
next
came
under
the
influence
of
the
Mycenaeans
(
at
around
1300
b.
c.
)
COMMA
who
had
a
base
in
the
Peloponnese
region
of
the
Greek
mainland
.

The
Mycenaeans
were
an
acquisitive
race
who
came
to
conquer
COMMA
not
to
trade
.

Their
extensive
military
campaigns
were
later
chronicled
by
Homer
in
his
epic
poems
The
Odyssey
and
The
Iliad
.

The
Rise
of
Athens

The
Dorians
COMMA
who
came
overland
from
northern
Europe
COMMA
conquered
the
Mycenaeans
.

They
were
a
barbaric
race
COMMA
and
their
custody
of
the
area
brought
about
a
dark
period
during
which
the
written
word
was
forgotten
and
art
disappeared
.

They
held
sway
over
islands
off
the
northern
Greek
coast
COMMA
but
the
Phoenicians
kept
control
of
the
main
sea
routes
;

south
of
the
area
COMMA
trade
continued
as
usual
.

At
the
same
time
COMMA
city-states
began
to
grow
in
influence
on
the
southern
Greek
mainland
.

Athens
became
the
most
powerful
COMMA
heralding
the
start
of
the
classical
Greek
period
.

However
COMMA
Greece
was
not
yet
a
country
;
each
city-state
was
self
-
governing
and
autonomous
.

The
new
culture
spread
throughout
the
Mediterranean
COMMA
helped
by
a
huge
increase
in
migration
from
the
mainland
to
new
settlements
such
as
Carthage
COMMA
a
Greek
city
on
the
African
coast
of
the
Mediterranean
.

Culture
and
the
arts
flourished
once
again
.

Athletic
prowess
was
admired
and
the
Olympic
games
were
constituted
in
776
b.
c.
COMMA
to
promote
friendly
competition
.

Homer
wrote
his
epic
works
on
Chios
;
and
lyrical
poetry
was
much
admired
COMMA
particularly
the
work
of
the
poets
Archilochos
on
Paros
and
Sappho
on
Lesvos
.

The
preeminent
islands
of
this
era
were
Delos
COMMA
a
sacred
island
and
center
of
religion
ruled
by
Athens
;
Samos
COMMA
ruled
by
the
tyrant
Polycrates
;
and
Naxos
COMMA
whose
ruler
Lygdamis
undertook
some
major
building
projects
.

Archaeology
shows
that
COMMA
during
this
time
COMMA
societies
lived
mainly
in
coastal
trading
towns
with
little
settlement
inland
.

The
Persian
Wars

As
Athens
rose
in
influence
and
power
in
the
West
COMMA
it
was
matched
in
the
East
by
the
rise
of
the
Persian
Empire
.

From
a
power
base
in
Anatolia
COMMA
the
Persians
overran
the
eastern
Aegean
Islands
and
set
their
sights
on
the
Cyclades
.

In
490
b.
c.
COMMA
they
captured
sacred
Delos
and
razed
the
settlements
on
Naxos
.

The
island
communities
were
undecided
about
which
side
to
back
for
a
time
.

Paros
and
Andros
contributed
to
the
Persian
armory
COMMA
while
others
supported
Athens
.

The
two
superpowers
finally
clashed
at
the
epic
battles
of
Marathon
and
Salamis
in
480
b.
c
.

The
Persians
were
defeated
COMMA
and
Athens
duly
punished
the
islands
that
had
turned
against
it
.

Following
its
victory
COMMA
Athens
introduced
the
concept
of
a
mutual
protection
alliance
(
a
kind
of
NATO
of
the
ancient
world
)
.

Several
islands
and
Greek
city-states
agreed
to
work
together
COMMA
and
created
a
treasury
to
fund
their
plans
COMMA
which
was
held
on
the
island
of
Delos
.

The
alliance
became
known
as
the
Delian
League
.

Although
there
were
minor
internal
wrangles
COMMA
the
league
controlled
the
Aegean
and
the
greater
Athenian
Empire
for
most
of
the
fifth
century
b.
c
.

Later
COMMA
in
454
b.
c.
COMMA
the
treasury
was
transferred
to
Athens
and
its
deposits
were
used
to
finance
the
construction
of
many
of
the
major
buildings
and
temples
of
the
Classical
Age
.

In
431
b.
c.
COMMA
Athens
began
a
war
with
its
neighbor
and
league
member
Sparta
.

Although
the
islands
saw
little
action
COMMA
as
the
war
went
on
they
could
see
that
Athens
was
slowly
losing
its
power
.

Before
the
end
of
the
war
in
401
b.
c.
COMMA
many
islands
had
already
transferred
their
allegiance
to
the
victors
COMMA
who
were
led
by
Philip
II
of
Macedon
.

He
was
followed
in
336
b.
c.
by
his
son
Alexander
the
Great
COMMA
one
of
the
most
remarkable
leaders
in
history
.

His
rise
to
power
ushered
in
the
Hellenistic
period
.

Hellenistic
and
Roman
Periods

When
Alexander
went
on
to
conquer
lands
as
far
to
the
east
as
India
COMMA
the
Aegean
became
a
crossroads
for
the
long
trading
routes
.

Delos
became
one
of
the
largest
marketplaces
in
the
empire
.

Following
Alexander
’s
death
COMMA
his
lands
were
divided
among
his
generals
.

Much
of
the
Aegean
came
under
the
rule
of
the
Ptolemies
COMMA
along
with
Egypt
.

Cleopatra
was
a
member
of
this
famous
ruling
clan
.

Although
in
88
b.
c.
COMMA
Mithradates
made
a
swift
and
successful
raid
from
the
East
across
Asia
Minor
and
the
Aegean
Islands
COMMA
the
next
major
power
change
brought
influence
from
the
West
.

The
Greek
Hellenistic
Empire
was
gradually
COMMA
and
peacefully
COMMA
absorbed
into
the
Roman
Empire
.

The
Byzantine
Empire
and
the
Coming
of
Christianity

The
Romans
ruled
a
pagan
empire
COMMA
but
the
Aegean
had
an
important
influence
on
the
early
development
of
Christianity
.

In
a.
d.
95
COMMA
St.
John
arrived
on
Patmos
COMMA
a
small
rocky
island
in
the
Dodecanese
COMMA
as
a
political
prisoner
.

It
was
here
that
he
wrote
what
was
to
become
the
final
book
of
the
New
Testament
COMMA
the
Book
of
Revelation
.

It
was
n’t
until
a.
d.
330
COMMA
however
COMMA
when
the
newly
converted
Emperor
Constantine
made
Byzantium
COMMA
renamed
Constantinople
COMMA
capital
of
his
Eastern
Empire
that
Christianity
was
assured
of
its
dominant
role
in
future
Greek
life
.

The
Byzantine
Empire
had
powerful
and
well
-
fortified
cities
COMMA
but
the
countryside
and
the
outlying
islands
were
ravaged
by
waves
of
invaders
.

In
an
attempt
to
counter
a
threat
from
the
Saracen
Muslims
COMMA
a
new
potent
religious
force
from
the
East
COMMA
the
Byzantine
army
forcefully
enlisted
the
men
of
the
islands
.

Disease
took
a
further
toll
.

By
the
time
of
the
Crusades
COMMA
many
of
the
Aegean
islands
had
been
practically
depopulated
.

As
the
Byzantine
Empire
weakened
at
the
end
of
the
first
millennium
COMMA
Crusader
forces
were
sent
from
Western
Europe
to
counter
the
Muslim
forces
and
retake
Jerusalem
for
the
Christian
faith
.

Unfortunately
COMMA
their
zeal
was
not
matched
by
their
discrimination
.

The
crusaders
swept
through
the
land
of
Byzantium
slaughtering
Christians
as
well
as
Muslims
COMMA
civilians
as
well
as
soldiers
.

Constantinople
was
taken
by
Crusader
forces
in
1204
COMMA
and
they
stripped
the
city
of
many
of
its
finest
treasures
—
which
now
grace
the
public
buildings
of
Venice
—
although
a
large
consignment
of
books
and
manuscripts
was
transferred
to
the
monastery
at
Patmos
before
the
city
fell
.

While
Byzantine
land
was
being
divided
COMMA
there
was
no
one
in
control
of
the
seas
COMMA
so
pirates
raided
towns
on
many
of
the
islands
.

To
counter
this
COMMA
the
populations
moved
from
their
homes
on
the
coast
and
built
settlements
inland
COMMA
out
of
sight
of
the
raiding
parties
.

This
created
a
pattern
seen
today
throughout
the
Aegean
of
a
small
port
(
skala
)
which
serves
an
inland
settlement
or
chora
COMMA
making
it
easier
to
protect
the
island
from
attack
.

The
minor
Aegean
Islands
were
taken
by
various
powerful
European
noblemen
COMMA
many
of
whom
were
Genoese
or
Venetian
COMMA
such
as
Marco
Sanudo
on
Naxos
.

The
noblemen
had
free
rein
to
create
their
own
fiefdoms
.

The
Venetians
fortified
their
main
towns
—
Naxos
Town
and
Antiparos
Town
are
wonderful
examples
of
this
—
creating
labyrinths
of
narrow
alleys
and
cul-de-sacs
that
were
designed
to
confuse
and
to
demoralize
invaders
.

The
Genoese
took
control
of
the
eastern
Aegean
Islands
COMMA
which
were
considered
the
most
valuable
for
agriculture
and
trade
.

After
a
final
bloody
defeat
by
the
Muslims
in
1309
COMMA
Christian
forces
were
forced
from
the
Holy
Land
.

The
Knights
of
St.
John
COMMA
a
holy
military
force
COMMA
made
their
way
to
Rhodes
and
Kos
in
the
Dodecanese
.

They
began
the
process
of
building
their
strong
citadels
COMMA
and
reinforcing
the
Christian
faith
on
the
islands
.

However
COMMA
they
had
not
seen
the
last
of
their
Muslim
foe
.

A
force
was
gaining
strength
in
the
east
to
threaten
their
new
bases
.

The
Coming
of
the
Ottoman
Turks

The
Ottomans
were
roving
invaders
who
came
from
the
east
COMMA
taking
land
in
what
is
now
Turkey
.

By
the
end
of
the
13th
century
COMMA
they
began
their
first
raids
on
the
Aegean
Islands
.

In
1453
COMMA
they
took
Constantinople
COMMA
and
immediately
made
it
their
capital
COMMA
renaming
it
Istanbul
.

They
then
set
their
sights
on
the
islands
of
the
Knights
of
St.
John
and
COMMA
after
an
unsuccessful
siege
in
1480
COMMA
they
finally
ejected
the
knights
from
the
Dodecanese
in
1522
.

In
1566
COMMA
they
wrested
Chios
from
the
Genoese
COMMA
bolstering
their
hold
on
the
eastern
Aegean
Islands
COMMA
but
the
Cyclades
remained
in
Venetian
hands
for
another
generation
or
more
—
Tinos
was
the
last
to
fall
in
1715
.

The
Ottomans
brought
new
influences
to
the
islands
that
they
controlled
COMMA
forming
a
large
empire
that
stretched
around
the
eastern
Mediterranean
.

Toward
Greek
Independence

However
COMMA
a
movement
was
growing
on
the
Greek
peninsula
against
Ottoman
rule
and
for
an
independent
Greek
state
.

In
1770
COMMA
Russia
came
to
aid
the
Greeks
(
defined
by
their
Orthodox
religion
rather
than
by
historical
geographical
boundaries
)
COMMA
declaring
war
on
the
Ottoman
Empire
and
occupying
several
Aegean
islands
until
1774
.

Graffiti
written
by
Russian
soldiers
can
be
seen
in
the
caves
of
Antiparos
.

Although
this
attempt
was
unsuccessful
COMMA
the
campaign
for
a
Greek
state
continued
into
the
19th
century
and
began
to
grow
in
strength
.

The
Aegean
Islands
played
their
part
.

Lesvos
COMMA
Chios
COMMA
and
Samos
lay
in
the
important
shipping
lanes
COMMA
and
patriots
began
disrupting
Ottoman
cargo
traffic
.

In
return
COMMA
the
Turks
violently
put
down
every
insurrection
COMMA
including
the
massacre
on
Chios
COMMA
when
22COMMA000
people
were
slaughtered
.

The
Ottoman
Empire
was
weakening
COMMA
however
COMMA
and
in
1821
COMMA
the
peoples
of
the
Greek
mainland
achieved
nationhood
for
the
first
time
.

The
Cyclades
and
the
Sporades
island
chains
were
also
included
in
this
new
state
.

A
new
sense
of
identity
enveloped
Greek
peoples
throughout
the
Aegean
COMMA
thus
commencing
a
movement
to
expand
Greece
and
unify
the
disparate
Orthodox
populations
.

The
Twentieth
Century

A
series
of
disastrous
decisions
at
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
began
to
sound
a
death
knell
for
the
Ottoman
Empire
.

The
Turks
lost
a
short
war
with
Italy
COMMA
and
were
forced
to
relinquish
the
Dodecanese
islands
to
the
Italians
.

Greece
took
this
opportunity
to
absorb
the
islands
of
the
northern
and
eastern
Aegean
and
to
add
Macedonia
to
its
mainland
territories
.

Following
this
debacle
COMMA
the
Ottomans
then
allied
themselves
to
Germany
in
the
World
War
I
COMMA
losing
more
territory
with
the
defeat
of
the
Germans
in
that
war
.

Greece
was
handed
a
strip
of
land
along
the
western
coast
of
Asia
Minor
COMMA
which
for
over
COMMA00
years
had
had
a
substantial
Greek
population
.

Greece
moved
in
to
administer
the
land
COMMA
but
a
new
influence
upset
any
grand
dreams
of
making
this
region
a
part
of
greater
Greece
.

In
1923
COMMA
Turkey
broke
away
from
the
tired
Ottoman
rulers
COMMA
and
Kemal
Ataturk
rose
to
power
on
a
wave
of
popular
support
.

He
promised
a
modern
state
for
his
people
COMMA
but
as
the
situation
became
volatile
COMMA
civil
strife
broke
out
in
Turkish
cities
COMMA
and
those
considered
Greek
were
victims
of
threats
and
violence
.

Many
had
to
leave
their
birthplaces
COMMA
fleeing
to
Lesvos
COMMA
Chios
COMMA
and
Samos
COMMA
the
Greek
-
ruled
islands
just
offshore
.

Thousands
of
people
arrived
with
little
more
than
the
clothes
they
wore
COMMA
putting
great
strain
on
the
resources
of
the
islands
.

Finally
COMMA
Greece
was
ousted
from
its
new
territory
in
Asia
Minor
COMMA
which
became
part
of
the
new
Turkish
state
.

Greece
attempted
to
stay
out
of
World
War
II
COMMA
but
Mussolini
saw
Greece
as
an
ideal
addition
to
his
Italian
empire
.

His
forces
made
a
series
of
attacks
from
their
bases
in
the
Dodecanese
islands
COMMA
including
sinking
a
Greek
naval
vessel
in
the
harbor
of
Tinos
Town
COMMA
but
they
only
succeeded
in
strengthening
the
resolve
of
the
population
against
them
.

Later
the
Germans
came
in
force
and
occupied
many
of
the
islands
.

After
the
war
COMMA
in
1949
COMMA
the
Dodecanese
islands
finally
became
part
of
the
Greek
nation
.

But
the
country
was
politically
fragmented
COMMA
with
arguments
between
monarchists
and
republicans
COMMA
right
and
left
COMMA
and
tension
escalated
into
civil
war
.

The
struggle
bypassed
most
of
the
islands
COMMA
although
there
was
fierce
fighting
on
Samos
.

Even
after
the
fighting
stopped
more
than
a
decade
later
COMMA
the
country
was
not
stable
.

At
the
same
time
COMMA
the
massive
growth
in
air
and
road
transport
saw
shipping
decline
in
importance
.

The
Aegean
Islands
COMMA
which
for
centuries
had
been
important
ports
on
the
trading
routes
COMMA
became
the
backwaters
of
this
new
transport
network
and
the
economies
of
several
islands
came
close
to
collapse
.

In
1967
COMMA
the
military
took
the
reins
of
power
in
Athens
COMMA
and
until
1974
COMMA
the
“
Colonels
”
held
sway
with
a
repressive
and
brutal
regime
.

Many
Greek
islanders
chose
to
leave
rather
than
live
in
poverty
and
terror
COMMA
and
many
made
new
homes
in
the
United
States
and
Australia
.

The
expansion
of
air
travel
began
the
age
of
mass
tourism
COMMA
and
Greece
along
with
the
Aegean
Islands
became
exciting
destinations
for
northern
Europeans
escaping
their
damp
COMMA
cool
summers
.

In
1982
COMMA
Greece
joined
the
European
Common
Market
(
now
the
European
Union
)
.

Since
this
time
COMMA
membership
has
been
of
great
monetary
benefit
to
the
country
.

The
EU
has
given
large
subsidies
to
develop
Greece
’s
infrastructure
and
grants
to
excavate
and
protect
its
ancient
monuments
.

Airfields
have
been
constructed
on
a
number
of
the
islands
COMMA
and
road
systems
have
been
expanded
and
improved
.

Private
investment
has
even
made
an
increasingly
modern
ferry
fleet
possible
.

Politically
COMMA
the
1990s
have
been
relatively
quiet
times
for
the
islands
COMMA
although
the
divorce
of
Greek
prime
minister
Andreas
Papandreou
and
his
subsequent
marriage
to
a
much
younger
woman
caused
consternation
within
conservative
Greek
society
.

As
the
Balkans
flared
to
war
once
again
COMMA
Greek
nationalism
has
stirred
COMMA
and
there
have
been
discussions
in
the
kafeneion
about
the
land
of
Macedonia
returning
to
the
fold
of
its
forefathers
.

Whether
this
will
ever
happen
remains
to
be
seen
COMMA
but
perhaps
the
aid
offered
by
Greece
to
Turkey
after
1999
’s
devastating
earthquake
is
a
sign
that
the
animosity
between
these
two
traditional
enemies
is
beginning
to
diminish
.

A
Brief
History

Jerusalem
's
recorded
history
begins
with
its
mention
in
Egyptian
court
records
4COMMA000
years
ago
COMMA
but
there
had
been
human
settlements
here
for
centuries
COMMA
probably
millennia
COMMA
before
that
.

At
the
beginning
of
the
second
millennium
b.
c.
COMMA
Jerusalem
was
a
Canaanite
mountain
stronghold
on
a
secondary
trade
route
COMMA
far
less
important
than
biblical
cities
such
as
Hazor
COMMA
Megiddo
COMMA
Beth
Shean
COMMA
and
Shechem
.

The
earliest
name
associated
with
the
city
COMMA
Ur
usalim
COMMA
perhaps
meant
"
city
of
Shalim
"
or
"
founded
by
Shalim
.
"

Scholars
speculate
that
Shalim
might
have
been
an
ancient
Semitic
deity
of
peace
COMMA
for
the
name
resembles
the
modern
Hebrew
and
Arabic
words
for
"
peace
"
:
shalom
and
salaam
COMMA
respectively
.

If
true
COMMA
this
is
an
ironic
name
for
a
city
that
would
become
one
of
the
most
constantly
and
bitterly
embattled
places
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.

Biblical
Jerusalem

In
the
Bible
COMMA
Genesis
14
:
18
-
20
records
that
Abraham
visited
the
city
of
"
Salem
"
in
approximately
1800
b.
c.
and
was
blessed
by
the
city
's
ruler
COMMA
Melchzedik
COMMA
who
offered
him
bread
and
wine
.

The
city
is
not
mentioned
again
in
the
Bible
until
the
time
of
the
great
poet
warrior
COMMA
King
David
COMMA
who
captured
the
city
from
the
Jebusites
in
about
1000
b.
c
.

The
Bible
describes
how
David
's
soldiers
conquered
Jerusalem
by
discovering
a
water
tunnel
under
the
walls
and
using
it
to
take
the
city
by
surprise
.

Warren
's
Shaft
COMMA
part
of
a
Canaanite
water
system
discovered
by
19th
-
century
archaeologists
and
open
to
visitors
COMMA
might
be
the
very
tunnel
infiltrated
by
David
's
army
.

Perhaps
because
Jerusalem
was
in
neutral
territory
not
allotted
to
any
of
the
twelve
rival
tribes
of
Israel
COMMA
David
made
it
the
capital
of
his
newly
formed
kingdom
and
brought
the
most
talented
artisans
COMMA
dedicated
priests
COMMA
magical
poets
and
musicians
COMMA
and
the
most
formidable
soldiers
from
each
of
the
tribes
to
live
in
his
city
.

He
also
brought
the
Ark
of
the
Covenant
COMMA
the
portable
tabernacle
containing
the
Tablets
of
the
Law
received
on
Mount
Sinai
COMMA
to
the
Spring
of
Gihon
COMMA
just
outside
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
.

There
the
Ark
rested
until
it
was
placed
in
the
Temple
COMMA
built
in
approximately
960
b.
c.
on
Mt.
Moriah
COMMA
the
high
point
at
the
northern
end
of
the
city
.

The
Temple
(
today
known
as
the
"
First
"
Temple
)
was
completed
by
David
's
son
and
successor
COMMA
King
Solomon
.

According
to
biblical
tradition
COMMA
although
David
bought
the
land
for
the
Temple
and
carefully
assembled
its
building
materials
COMMA
he
was
deemed
unworthy
of
constructing
the
Temple
because
he
was
a
man
of
war
with
blood
on
his
hands
.

At
the
Temple
's
dedication
COMMA
Solomon
addressed
his
God
:
"
...
the
Heavens
COMMA
even
the
Heaven
of
the
Heavens
COMMA
can
not
contain
Thee
;
how
much
less
this
House
that
I
have
built
?
"

The
site
of
the
Temple
eventually
became
identified
as
Mt.
Moriah
COMMA
on
which
it
stood
COMMA
where
Abraham
was
called
to
sacrifice
his
son
Isaac
.

Along
with
this
splendid
house
of
worship
COMMA
Solomon
built
a
royal
palace
COMMA
mansions
for
his
wives
COMMA
temples
for
the
foreign
gods
worshipped
by
the
princesses
he
had
married
COMMA
and
towers
for
the
defense
of
the
capital
.

Under
the
wise
reign
of
Solomon
COMMA
the
city
flourished
as
the
capital
of
an
empire
that
stretched
from
Damascus
to
the
Red
Sea
and
controlled
the
trade
routes
from
Egypt
to
Phoenicia
.

The
Temple
and
royal
palace
were
adorned
with
gold
and
ivory
from
Africa
and
with
cedar
from
Lebanon
;

the
beauties
and
glories
of
Jerusalem
under
Solomon
have
captivated
readers
of
the
Bible
for
almost
3COMMA000
years
.

But
with
his
death
the
empire
collapsed
COMMA
and
the
Israelite
kingdom
was
divided
into
two
separate
COMMA
impoverished
COMMA
often
warring
nations
:
Israel
COMMA
with
its
capital
at
Shechem
in
the
north
COMMA
ruled
by
a
series
of
northern
dynasties
;
and
the
smaller
kingdom
of
Judah
COMMA
with
its
capital
at
Jerusalem
COMMA
from
which
the
Davidic
dynasty
continued
to
rule
.

The
Bible
tells
us
that
the
cruelty
and
impiety
of
the
rulers
of
both
kingdoms
aroused
the
fury
of
the
great
Prophets
.

In
701
b.
c.
the
Assyrian
armies
of
Sennacherib
destroyed
Israel
and
moved
southward
to
besiege
Jerusalem
.

Thanks
to
King
Hezekiah
's
hidden
water
tunnel
COMMA
the
city
narrowly
escaped
destruction
.

The
end
of
David
's
dynasty
came
in
587
b.
c.
COMMA
when
Nebuchadnezzar
COMMA
King
of
Babylon
COMMA
invaded
Judah
to
lay
siege
to
Jerusalem
.

When
it
fell
COMMA
the
Temple
and
all
the
buildings
were
burned
.

The
people
of
the
once
-
glorious
city
were
forced
into
an
exile
known
as
"
the
Babylonian
Captivity
.
"

In
time
COMMA
the
kingdom
of
Babylon
was
overthrown
and
the
Israelites
were
permitted
to
return
to
Jerusalem
in
539
b.
c
.

The
city
was
now
under
the
more
tolerant
rule
of
the
Persians
COMMA
but
rebuilding
was
slow
work
.

The
Second
Temple
was
finished
in
515
b.
c.
COMMA
but
much
of
the
city
still
lay
in
ruins
.

Jerusalem
submitted
peaceably
to
the
rule
of
the
Greeks
in
332
b.
c.
under
Alexander
the
Great
and
COMMA
subsequently
COMMA
to
his
Hellenistic
successors
as
well
as
the
Egyptian
Ptolomeys
and
the
Syrian
Seleucids
.

When
Seleucid
rulers
outlawed
Judaism
COMMA
Jews
led
by
Judah
Maccabee
and
his
brothers
staged
a
revolution
in
167
b.
c.
and
COMMA
against
all
odds
COMMA
restored
the
primacy
of
Jewish
religious
life
in
Jerusalem
.

The
Macabbees
cleansed
the
Temple
of
Hellenistic
idols
and
the
blood
of
pagan
sacrifices
;
the
eight
-
day
celebration
of
Hanukkah
(
Feast
of
Dedication
)
commemorates
their
victory
.

The
Hasmonean
dynasty
COMMA
descendants
of
the
Maccabee
family
COMMA
ruled
an
independent
Jewish
Commonwealth
that
stretched
from
the
Negev
to
the
Galilee
.

Jerusalem
grew
COMMA
surrounded
with
a
formidable
wall
and
defended
by
towers
beside
the
Jaffa
Gate
.

The
Hasmoneans
ruled
until
Pompey
's
Roman
legions
arrived
in
63
b.
c
.

Roman
Jerusalem

After
the
initial
years
of
Roman
administration
and
political
infighting
COMMA
Rome
installed
Herod
(
scion
of
a
family
from
Idumea
COMMA
a
Jewish
kingdom
in
the
desert
)
as
King
of
Judea
.

He
reigned
from
37
to
4
b.
c.
COMMA
during
which
time
he
fortified
the
Hasmonean
wall
and
rebuilt
the
defense
towers
beside
Jaffa
Gate
COMMA
the
foundation
of
which
still
stand
.

Several
palaces
were
built
and
a
water
system
installed
.

Herod
also
completely
rebuilt
the
Temple
COMMA
making
it
one
of
the
most
important
religious
centers
in
the
Roman
Empire
.

The
courtyard
around
the
Temple
was
expanded
to
accommodate
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pilgrims
COMMA
and
the
Temple
Mount
was
shored
up
by
retaining
walls
made
with
great
stone
blocks
.

One
of
these
walls
COMMA
the
Western
Wall
COMMA
is
today
a
major
reminder
of
Jerusalem
's
greatness
under
Herod
.

A
massive
fortress
was
built
overlooking
the
Temple
Mount
COMMA
which
Herod
named
"
Antonia
"
in
honor
of
his
Roman
friend
and
benefactor
COMMA
Mark
Antony
.

For
all
his
accomplishments
COMMA
Herod
was
nevertheless
hated
by
his
subjects
;
he
taxed
COMMA
he
tortured
COMMA
and
he
ordered
the
massacre
of
male
Jewish
infants
in
an
attempt
to
do
away
with
the
heralded
Messiah
.

When
Jesus
was
born
in
about
4
b.
c.
COMMA
Joseph
and
Mary
escaped
Herod
's
paranoia
by
fleeing
into
Egypt
with
the
new
-
born
infant
.

They
returned
to
live
in
the
Galilee
village
of
Nazareth
COMMA
making
pilgrimages
to
Jerusalem
.

According
to
biblical
accounts
COMMA
Jesus
spent
his
life
ministering
in
the
Galilee
Valley
.

In
about
a.
d.
30
he
and
his
followers
went
for
Passover
to
Jerusalem
COMMA
which
was
in
unrest
at
this
time
COMMA
dissatisfied
with
Roman
domination
.

Jesus
's
entry
into
the
Temple
caused
a
commotion
;
after
the
Passover
dinner
he
was
arrested
by
the
temple
priests
COMMA
who
were
under
direct
Roman
rule
.

Jesus
was
put
on
trial
quickly
and
condemned
to
crucifixion
COMMA
a
Roman
form
of
execution
for
political
and
religious
dissidents
as
well
as
for
common
criminals
.

In
a
province
rife
with
rebellion
and
retaliation
COMMA
the
execution
in
Jerusalem
of
yet
another
religious
leader
from
the
Galilee
did
not
by
itself
have
an
immediate
effect
on
history
.

After
Jesus
's
crucifixion
COMMA
harsh
Roman
rule
continued
until
a.
d.
66
COMMA
when
the
Jews
rebelled
.

For
four
years
Jewish
zealots
fought
against
the
might
of
Rome
.

At
the
end
COMMA
the
Roman
general
Titus
laid
siege
to
Jerusalem
in
a.
d.
70
COMMA
finally
attacking
its
starved
and
weakened
defenders
.

Those
who
did
n't
escape
were
executed
or
sold
into
slavery
.

The
Holy
City
and
the
Temple
were
destroyed
.

The
last
of
the
zealots
held
out
for
another
three
years
at
Masada
(
see
page
76
)
.

Half
a
million
civilians
died
in
the
Galilee
and
Judea
as
a
result
of
this
first
revolt
against
Rome
COMMA
a
number
unequaled
in
ancient
warfare
.

Christian
and
Islamic
Jerusalem

For
60
years
Jerusalem
lay
in
ruins
COMMA
until
the
Roman
Emperor
Hadrian
ordered
the
city
rebuilt
as
a
Roman
town
dedicated
to
Jupiter
.

In
outrage
COMMA
the
Jews
began
a
second
revolt
against
Rome
COMMA
led
by
Simon
bar
Kochba
.

The
ruins
of
Jerusalem
were
briefly
liberated
COMMA
but
COMMA
in
the
end
COMMA
Jewish
resistance
to
Rome
was
defeated
with
great
loss
of
life
.

The
planned
new
Roman
city
COMMA
Aelia
Capitolina
COMMA
was
built
over
the
ruins
of
Herodian
Jerusalem
COMMA
and
Jews
were
barred
from
residing
there
for
all
time
.

Jerusalem
's
physical
existence
as
a
spiritual
city
seemed
finished
COMMA
but
its
spiritual
power
for
Jews
COMMA
and
for
the
struggling
new
Christian
religion
COMMA
remained
.

For
the
next
two
centuries
Aelia
Capitolina
enjoyed
an
innocuous
history
.

But
the
Roman
Empire
became
Christian
in
the
fourth
century
COMMA
and
Jerusalem
became
a
center
of
religion
once
again
.

Queen
Helena
COMMA
a
devout
Christian
and
the
mother
of
Emperor
Constantine
the
Great
COMMA
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Holy
Land
in
326
to
identify
the
sites
associated
with
Jesus
's
life
.

She
found
that
the
city
's
most
beautiful
Roman
temple
COMMA
dedicated
to
the
goddess
Aphrodite
COMMA
stood
on
the
site
of
the
crucifixion
.

The
temple
was
demolished
and
a
vast
COMMA
Classical
-
style
church
was
built
around
Golgotha
(
the
hill
where
Jesus
's
crucifixion
was
believed
to
have
taken
place
)
.

Throughout
Jerusalem
COMMA
other
spots
important
to
Jesus
's
life
were
commemorated
with
religious
structures
.

Pilgrims
came
from
all
over
the
Roman
(
and
COMMA
later
COMMA
Byzantine
)
Empire
during
the
following
centuries
COMMA
but
the
prosperity
they
brought
lasted
only
until
614
COMMA
when
Persian
armies
overtook
Judea
and
reduced
Jerusalem
to
rubble
again
.

In
629
COMMA
Jerusalem
was
recaptured
by
the
Byzantines
.

Still
reeling
from
the
effects
of
the
Persian
devastation
COMMA
Jerusalem
was
conquered
in
638
by
the
forces
of
Islam
.

The
Temple
Mount
was
identified
in
Islamic
tradition
as
"
the
farthest
spot
"
(
in
Arabic
COMMA
el-aksa
)
COMMA
the
site
to
which
the
Prophet
Muhammad
was
transported
in
one
night
from
Mecca
on
a
winged
horse
COMMA
as
described
in
the
17th
chapter
of
the
Koran
.

From
here
the
Prophet
ascended
to
the
heavens
and
was
permitted
to
glimpse
paradise
.

The
rock
on
the
Temple
Mount
from
which
he
ascended
COMMA
at
or
close
to
the
site
of
the
ruined
Temple
COMMA
was
commemorated
by
the
construction
of
the
Dome
of
the
Rock
in
691
.

The
Dome
of
the
Rock
remains
Jerusalem
's
most
striking
monument
;
it
is
counted
among
the
most
beautiful
buildings
ever
created
.

By
about
715
COMMA
the
El-Aksa
Mosque
COMMA
third
holiest
place
of
prayer
in
Islam
(
after
Mecca
and
Medina
)
COMMA
had
been
built
on
the
southern
side
of
the
Temple
Mount
.

Jerusalem
continued
under
Islamic
rule
for
the
next
four
and
a
half
centuries
.

In
1099
COMMA
under
their
leaders
Godfrey
de
Bouillon
and
Tancred
COMMA
the
Crusaders
captured
the
Holy
City
for
Christendom
by
slaughtering
both
Muslims
and
Jews
.

Crusaders
COMMA
Mamelukes
COMMA
and
Turks

The
Crusaders
established
a
feudal
Christian
state
with
Godfrey
at
its
head
.

They
built
many
impressive
churches
during
the
term
of
the
first
Latin
Kingdom
of
Jerusalem
COMMA
but
in
1187
they
were
driven
out
by
Muslim
forces
under
the
great
warrior
Saladin
.

During
the
Sixth
Crusade
(
1228
-
1229
)
COMMA
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Frederick
II
managed
to
secure
Jerusalem
for
the
Christians
by
negotiation
.

The
Christians
COMMA
however
COMMA
could
not
hold
the
city
.

After
they
lost
Jerusalem
COMMA
a
Mongol
invasion
swept
through
COMMA
and
in
1244
the
Mameluke
dynasty
of
Egypt
took
control
COMMA
ruling
Jerusalem
for
the
next
250
years
.

The
city
struggled
to
rebuild
from
Crusader
wars
and
invasions
.

Much
of
the
best
Islamic
architecture
in
the
city
was
constructed
in
the
Mameluke
era
COMMA
but
the
past
thousand
years
had
taken
their
toll
:

Jerusalem
was
unable
to
regain
the
prosperity
it
had
enjoyed
in
earlier
times
.

In
the
early
16th
century
COMMA
the
Ottoman
Turkish
Empire
was
advancing
through
the
Middle
East
.

Jerusalem
fell
to
the
Ottomans
in
1517
COMMA
remaining
under
their
control
for
400
years
.

Suleiman
the
Magnificent
rebuilt
the
walls
and
gates
in
the
form
they
retain
to
this
day
.

Fountains
COMMA
inns
COMMA
religious
schools
COMMA
and
barracks
were
constructed
.

But
when
Suleiman
died
COMMA
his
empire
COMMA
including
Jerusalem
COMMA
began
a
long
period
of
decline
.

The
Holy
City
remained
a
backwater
until
the
19th
century
COMMA
when
renewed
interest
among
Christian
pilgrims
made
it
the
destination
of
thousands
of
travelers
each
year
.

19th
-
Century
Aspirations

At
the
same
time
COMMA
many
Jews
sought
religious
freedom
and
fulfillment
by
moving
to
Palestine
(
as
the
Holy
Land
was
traditionally
called
)
and
especially
to
Jerusalem
.

In
the
1890s
COMMA
Theodor
Herzl
(
1860
-
1904
)
worked
to
organize
a
movement
COMMA
Zionism
COMMA
to
create
a
Jewish
state
.

Chaim
Weizmann
(
1874
-
1952
)
COMMA
a
scientist
born
in
Russia
but
later
a
British
subject
COMMA
did
much
to
put
Herzl
's
hopes
into
practice
.

Weizmann
was
an
important
figure
in
the
negotiations
with
the
British
government
that
led
to
the
Balfour
Declaration
of
1917
COMMA
supporting
the
idea
of
a
Jewish
"
national
home
"
in
Palestine
that
also
respected
the
rights
of
existing
non-Jewish
people
already
living
there
.

The
problem
was
that
British
strategists
COMMA
who
were
fighting
the
Ottoman
Turks
in
1917
COMMA
had
secretly
promised
the
lands
to
their
World
War
I
Arab
allies
.

In
1922
the
League
of
Nations
granted
the
British
a
mandate
to
administer
Palestine
.

Jerusalem
flourished
during
the
early
years
of
the
Mandate
.

Modern
neighborhoods
COMMA
hospitals
COMMA
schools
COMMA
and
the
Hebrew
University
were
built
in
West
Jerusalem
COMMA
the
new
Jewish
enclave
.

But
Arab
opposition
to
new
Jewish
immigration
and
construction
in
Palestine
led
to
increasing
strife
;
by
1946
COMMA
Jerusalem
was
an
armed
camp
.

In
1947
the
United
Nations
voted
for
the
partition
of
Palestine
into
two
states
COMMA
one
Jewish
and
one
Arab
COMMA
with
Jerusalem
as
an
international
city
that
belonged
to
neither
.

But
lacking
the
means
to
enforce
its
decision
COMMA
the
United
Nations
was
powerless
to
halt
the
fighting
that
erupted
as
the
British
withdrew
their
troops
in
1948
.

Modern
Israel

The
State
of
Israel
was
declared
during
this
difficult
time
.

In
response
COMMA
member
states
of
the
Arab
League
sent
troops
to
help
the
Palestinian
Arabs
.

West
Jerusalem
COMMA
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
new
Jewish
nation
COMMA
held
out
under
siege
for
several
months
until
Israeli
forces
secured
a
land
corridor
connecting
the
city
to
the
coastal
areas
.

Jews
were
evacuated
from
the
Old
City
's
Jewish
Quarter
COMMA
and
thousands
of
Arab
families
fled
their
homes
in
West
Jerusalem
.

As
a
result
of
armistice
agreements
in
1949
COMMA
Jerusalem
was
divided
:

West
Jerusalem
was
to
be
under
Israeli
control
COMMA
and
East
Jerusalem
(
including
the
Old
City
COMMA
with
its
Jewish
COMMA
Muslim
COMMA
Christian
COMMA
and
Armenian
quarters
)
came
under
Jordanian
authority
.

Free
access
to
holy
sites
for
members
of
all
religions
was
guaranteed
by
the
armistice
agreements
.

However
COMMA
with
the
city
partitioned
by
fortifications
and
barbed
wire
COMMA
no
Israeli
or
Jewish
pilgrims
were
allowed
to
visit
the
Western
Wall
or
other
Jewish
sites
in
East
Jerusalem
.

For
the
next
19
years
COMMA
Jerusalem
was
two
cities
.

Political
and
religious
boundaries
were
aggravated
by
occasional
incidents
of
terrorism
or
sniping
until
the
Six
Day
War
in
June
1967
.

Within
three
days
the
city
was
completely
in
Israeli
hands
COMMA
and
in
two
weeks
it
was
physically
and
administratively
reunited
.

Jerusalem
's
mayor
COMMA
Teddy
Kollek
COMMA
spent
the
next
25
years
orchestrating
a
vast
program
of
development
COMMA
adding
new
cultural
institutions
and
parks
and
instituting
neighborhood
restoration
projects
while
tirelessly
mediating
the
concerns
of
Jerusalem
's
many
communities
.

Today
COMMA
as
always
COMMA
Jerusalem
is
a
city
of
controversies
:
religious
Jews
in
conflict
with
secular
Jews
;
Palestinians
calling
for
independence
;
many
residents
protesting
a
wave
of
high-rise
development
that
many
claim
will
turn
the
Holy
City
into
a
holy
megalopolis
.

But
the
ideas
and
mystique
that
have
always
made
this
an
extraordinarily
special
place
rise
above
the
ebbing
and
flowing
concerns
of
present
-
day
Jerusalem
as
it
continues
to
tug
at
the
world
's
attention
into
the
new
millennium
.

A
Physics
of
Semantics
?

Each
of
the
chapters
of
Investigations
broaches
new
territory
.

Each
is
tentative
and
incomplete
COMMA
pointing
but
not
fully
adequate
.

Yet
COMMA
I
persistently
hope
COMMA
it
is
better
to
light
one
candle
against
...
what
?

the
darkness
?

the
veil
beyond
which
we
have
had
no
framework
of
questions
before
?

There
are
grounds
COMMA
reasoned
about
by
the
best
of
philosophers
and
scientists
of
the
past
several
centuries
COMMA
to
doubt
a
physics
of
semantics
.

We
are
on
shaky
ground
.

Yet
when
the
first
hard
frost
comes
COMMA
when
the
birches
have
been
swung
COMMA
their
crimson
leaves
scattered
carelessly
COMMA
when
crystals
splint
shallow
ponds
and
old
egrets
stand
dark
watch
the
coming
dawn
COMMA
long-legged
COMMA
knowing
how
winter
is
thin
COMMA
when
the
first
phase
transition
of
water
to
ice
forms
slight
solidity
across
meadow
streams
COMMA
small
creatures
of
flesh
and
concept
tiptoe
gingerly
to
some
far
side
where
COMMA
perhaps
COMMA
something
new
is
to
be
found
.

We
have
lacked
a
physical
definition
of
an
autonomous
agent
COMMA
able
to
manipulate
the
universe
on
its
own
behalf
—
the
egret
whose
foreboding
of
winter
leads
to
lifted
wing
and
steady
COMMA
powerful
flight
.

The
egret
is
as
much
a
part
of
physical
reality
as
the
atom
COMMA
and
perhaps
more
than
the
vaunted
quark
.

But
autonomous
agents
COMMA
we
who
do
daily
manipulate
the
world
on
our
own
behalf
COMMA
we
to
whom
"
intentionality
"
and
"
purpose
"
are
so
inevitably
attributed
by
our
common
languages
COMMA
we
are
COMMA
by
my
definition
of
autonomous
agents
COMMA
also
nothing
but
physical
systems
with
a
peculiar
organization
of
processes
and
properties
.

If
the
concept
of
autonomous
agents
were
something
like
a
useful
—
more
COMMA
a
proper
—
definition
of
life
itself
COMMA
then
autonomous
agents
span
the
gap
from
the
merely
physical
to
that
new
realm
of
the
merely
physical
where
"
purpose
"
is
ascribed
by
all
of
us
to
one
another
.

Semantics
enters
with
purpose
.

For
this
to
be
true
COMMA
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
carriers
of
purpose
COMMA
say
COMMA
the
same
bacterium
heading
upstream
in
the
glucose
gradient
COMMA
be
conscious
.

I
hope
my
definition
of
an
autonomous
agent
is
useful
COMMA
an
autocatalytic
system
carrying
out
a
work
cycle
COMMA
now
rather
broadened
by
the
realization
that
autonomous
agents
also
do
often
detect
and
measure
and
record
displacements
of
external
systems
from
equilibrium
that
can
be
used
to
extract
work
COMMA
then
do
extract
work
COMMA
propagating
work
and
constraint
construction
COMMA
from
their
environment
.

Know-how

Bring
ourselves
empathetically
and
objectively
back
three
billion
years
to
the
mixed
microbial
community
flourishing
right
about
where
most
of
us
are
now
COMMA
plus
or
minus
a
modicum
of
layers
of
surface
crustal
material
.

I
want
to
say
that
the
autonomous
agents
comprising
that
community
had
COMMA
individually
and
collectively
COMMA
the
embodied
know-how
to
get
on
with
making
a
living
in
the
natural
games
that
constituted
their
world
.

Indeed
COMMA
as
I
have
emphasized
before
COMMA
a
biosphere
is
a
self
-
consistent
coconstruction
of
autonomous
agents
COMMA
ways
of
making
a
living
COMMA
and
the
search
procedures
COMMA
mutation
COMMA
recombination
COMMA
as
well
as
behavioral
search
open
to
autonomous
agents
.

Those
means
of
making
a
living
that
were
well
searched
out
and
mastered
by
the
agents
and
their
search
procedures
became
the
kinds
of
"
jobs
"
that
were
widely
filled
COMMA
the
abundant
niches
of
the
bio-sphere
.

There
is
in
this
whole
self
-
constructing
system
a
wider
know-how
COMMA
beyond
the
know-how
of
any
single
autonomous
agent
spinning
eagerly
in
its
microenvironment
.

Yet
COMMA
clearly
COMMA
the
know-how
is
distributed
.

There
is
no
autonomous
agent
COMMA
no
one
COMMA
who
knows
how
the
whole
system
works
COMMA
any
more
than
anyone
at
present
knows
how
the
global
economic
system
works
in
its
myriad
interactions
COMMA
deals
COMMA
steals
COMMA
hopes
COMMA
and
frustrations
.

What
in
the
world
is
"
know-how
"
?

Philosophers
distinguish
between
"
know-how
"
and
"
know
that
.
"

I
know
how
to
tie
my
shoes
and
am
learning
how
to
play
jazz
drums
.

"
Know
that
"
concerns
propositions
COMMA
most
conveniently
COMMA
human
propositions
.

I
know
that
the
moon
is
—
they
tell
me
—
not
made
of
green
cheese
.

I
know
that
the
earth
circles
the
sun
COMMA
that
the
earth
is
roughly
spherical
COMMA
that
chairs
are
used
to
sit
on
.

"
Know
that
"
brings
with
it
the
standard
and
nonstandard
issues
of
the
truth
or
falseness
of
propositions
as
they
report
states
of
the
world
.

Perhaps
higher
primates
who
are
trained
to
manipulate
simple
symbols
with
apparent
reference
to
the
world
also
can
"
know
that
"
with
respect
to
propositions
.

Unlike
"
know
that
COMMA
"
"
know-how
"
does
not
involve
propositions
about
the
world
.

"
Know-how
"
involves
procedural
knowledge
about
how
to
get
on
in
the
world
.

The
cheetah
streaking
after
the
wildebeest
COMMA
the
athletic
genius
high
jumping
COMMA
have
the
know-how
to
do
it
.

Does
a
bacterium
know
how
to
make
a
living
in
its
world
?

I
certainly
want
to
say
yes
COMMA
without
attributing
consciousness
in
any
way
.

Watch
the
myriad
subtle
turnings
on
and
off
of
genes
COMMA
metabolic
switching
COMMA
mechanical
twitching
COMMA
sensing
of
glucose
gradient
COMMA
swimming
and
tumbling
upstream
to
higher
glucose
concentrations
.

It
knows
how
all
right
COMMA
even
if
it
can
not
talk
about
how
it
gets
on
with
its
business
.

But
then
COMMA
try
to
talk
about
tying
your
shoes
or
the
skilled
driving
when
you
become
aware
some
dozens
of
miles
down
the
road
that
you
have
accomplished
the
tasks
without
paying
the
slightest
focused
attention
.

Thank
God
for
know-how
.

Know
that
is
a
thin
veneer
on
a
four
-
billion
-
year
-
old
know-how
skill
abundant
in
the
biosphere
.

But
any
autonomous
agent
proliferating
alone
or
in
a
congery
of
other
agents
COMMA
it
would
seem
COMMA
is
also
graced
by
the
selfsame
know-how
.

If
we
synthesize
autonomous
agents
in
the
next
decades
and
they
coevolve
under
our
rapt
gaze
over
months
or
years
into
a
modestly
complex
ecosystem
brimming
with
novel
life
forms
COMMA
they
too
will
know
how
to
make
a
living
in
their
mutually
created
world
plus
the
boundary
conditions
we
more
or
less
intelligently
impose
on
them
.

The
know-how
is
COMMA
in
these
terms
COMMA
nothing
but
another
view
of
the
propagating
closures
of
catalysis
COMMA
work
tasks
COMMA
sensing
COMMA
recording
COMMA
and
acting
that
we
now
recognize
as
inherent
in
the
doings
of
autonomous
agents
.

The
know-how
is
not
outside
that
propagating
organization
.

The
know-how
is
the
propagating
organization
.

Semantics

All
of
which
brings
us
COMMA
inevitably
COMMA
to
the
brink
of
semantics
.

It
is
simple
at
its
roots
COMMA
you
see
.

An
incoming
molecular
species
arriving
in
the
interior
of
an
autonomous
agent
really
is
(
i
)
food
;
(
ii
)
poison
;
(
iii
)
a
signal
;
(
iv
)
neutral
;
(
v
)
something
else
.

Once
there
is
an
autonomous
agent
COMMA
there
is
a
semantics
from
its
privileged
point
of
view
.

The
incoming
molecule
is
"
yuck
"
or
"
yum
.
"

I
think
the
major
conceptual
step
to
yuck
or
yum
is
unavoidable
once
there
is
an
autonomous
agent
.

And
I
think
we
have
roughly
the
Darwinian
criteria
in
mind
.

If
yum
COMMA
then
there
will
probably
be
more
of
this
type
of
agent
COMMA
offsprings
of
the
first
.

If
yuck
COMMA
it
is
not
so
likely
this
lineage
will
prosper
.

Once
yuck
and
yum
COMMA
we
are
not
far
from
C.
S.
Pierce
's
meaning
-
laden
semiotic
triad
:
sign
COMMA
signified
COMMA
significans
.

Like
it
or
not
COMMA
the
glucose
gradient
is
a
sign
COMMA
a
predictor
COMMA
of
"
more
glucose
that
way
.
"

Granted
COMMA
the
glucose
is
not
an
arbitrary
symbol
COMMA
any
more
than
a
cloud
is
an
arbitrary
symbol
of
rain
.

In
this
restricted
sense
COMMA
signs
are
causally
correlated
with
that
which
is
signified
.

By
contrast
COMMA
the
relation
between
the
word
"
chair
"
and
that
which
it
signifies
COMMA
and
on
which
I
am
now
sitting
COMMA
is
arbitrary
.

But
can
chemical
signals
in
bacterial
and
plant
and
human
communities
be
arbitrary
from
a
chemical
causal
point
of
view
?

If
so
COMMA
can
"
mere
chemicals
"
be
signs
in
the
full
Piercean
sense
?

I
believe
it
is
clear
that
mere
chemistry
in
an
autonomous
agent
can
harbor
symbols
and
signs
in
the
full
senses
of
the
words
.

Consider
first
the
famous
genetic
code
.

Triplets
of
nucleotides
in
an
RNA
molecule
stand
for
specific
amino
acids
that
will
end
up
incorporated
into
a
protein
.

The
detailed
causal
machinery
involves
transfer
RNA
molecules
with
their
anticodon
site
and
the
distant
site
to
which
amino
acids
are
attached
COMMA
the
aminoacyle
transferase
enzymes
that
charge
the
amino
acid
binding
site
of
each
transfer
RNA
with
the
proper
amino
acid
among
the
twenty
amino
acids
COMMA
the
binding
of
the
charged
transfer
RNA
's
anticodon
site
to
the
proper
RNA
code
word
triplet
COMMA
the
ribosome
that
glides
between
adjacent
charged
transfer
RNA
molecules
and
links
the
successive
amino
acids
into
the
growing
polypeptide
chain
that
hangs
free
in
the
cytoplasm
COMMA
tethered
by
the
ribosome
to
the
messenger
RNA
molecule
as
it
is
"
translated
.
"

The
arbitrariness
of
the
genetic
code
is
exemplified
by
the
evolution
of
novel
transfer
RNA
molecules
COMMA
which
translate
a
given
messenger
RNA
code
word
triplet
into
a
different
amino
acid
.

As
J.
Monod
properly
emphasized
three
decades
ago
in
a
slightly
different
context
concerning
activation
and
inhibition
of
enzymes
at
allosteric
sites
on
the
enzyme
that
are
distant
from
the
catalytic
site
COMMA
the
relation
of
chemical
structures
that
achieve
control
of
catalysis
are
utterly
arbitrary
with
respect
to
the
chemical
structures
that
undergo
the
catalysis
.

The
same
is
true
of
the
transfer
RNA
where
the
anticodon
site
is
distant
from
the
amino
acid
binding
site
.

Because
of
this
COMMA
which
amino
acid
is
charged
onto
a
particular
transfer
RNA
is
utterly
arbitrary
and
controlled
by
the
aminoacyle
transferase
enzyme
that
does
the
charging
COMMA
plus
the
structure
of
the
amino
acid
binding
site
on
the
transfer
RNA
.

Both
of
these
can
be
altered
without
altering
the
anticodon
-
codon
matching
mechanism
.

In
short
COMMA
chemistry
allows
arbitrary
organizations
of
control
relations
.

It
seems
fully
legitimate
to
assign
the
concepts
of
sign
COMMA
signified
COMMA
and
significans
to
the
genetic
code
.

It
seems
legitimate
to
extend
that
notion
to
much
of
the
subtle
signaling
COMMA
chemical
and
otherwise
COMMA
within
and
between
autonomous
agents
COMMA
as
exemplified
by
plants
that
upon
infestation
by
a
particular
insect
secrete
a
secondary
metabolite
chemical
that
"
warns
"
other
members
of
the
same
species
that
an
insect
infestation
is
happening
and
to
turn
on
defensive
anti-insect
secondary
metabolites
.

The
calculus
that
is
Claude
Shannon
's
elegant
information
theory
has
always
been
about
reduction
of
uncertainty
about
the
statistics
of
the
source
of
a
set
of
symbols
.

Nowhere
in
the
core
of
Shannon
's
work
concerning
the
encoding
and
transmission
of
information
does
the
meaning
COMMA
or
semantics
COMMA
of
the
information
enter
.

This
is
no
criticism
COMMA
and
is
widely
known
and
appreciated
.

There
is
COMMA
however
COMMA
just
a
hint
of
semantics
in
Shannon
's
view
that
the
semantics
resides
in
the
"
decoder
.
"

I
can
not
buy
Shannon
's
view
unless
the
decoder
is
an
autonomous
agent
.

If
not
COMMA
then
the
decoder
merely
transforms
a
bit
string
sent
along
a
communication
channel
into
some
other
discrete
or
continuous
dynamics
—
perhaps
a
set
of
water
-
filled
bowls
is
drained
by
turning
on
a
machine
that
opens
valves
between
the
bowls
and
to
the
outside
world
in
particular
ways
.

The
patterns
of
bowl
drainage
upon
receipt
of
the
binary
string
messages
sent
along
the
communication
channel
constitutes
the
decoding
.

But
if
the
recipient
is
an
autonomous
agent
such
as
a
bacterium
and
the
incoming
molecule
is
a
symbol-sign
of
a
paramecium
or
an
amoeba
on
the
roam
and
the
bacterium
swims
away
and
avoids
becoming
dinner
COMMA
that
sequence
of
events
seems
laden
with
semantics
.

If
only
the
bacterium
could
tell
us
:

"
Did
you
see
that
truck
of
a
paramecium
coming
at
me
?

I
've
run
into
that
one
before
!

I
ducked
under
a
boulder
COMMA
and
he
never
sensed
me
.

I
made
it
home
.

Pass
me
some
more
glucose
please
COMMA
Martha
.
"

I
will
return
in
the
next
chapter
to
discuss
such
stories
COMMA
for
I
will
say
that
we
can
not
prestate
the
configuration
space
of
a
biosphere
and
COMMA
therefore
COMMA
can
not
deduce
that
which
will
unfold
.

Thus
COMMA
among
other
things
COMMA
we
must
tell
stories
to
understand
the
oriented
actions
of
agents
in
their
worlds
.

Do
not
be
overly
quick
to
accuse
me
of
anthropomorphizing
.

I
too
know
the
risks
COMMA
including
the
common
claim
that
we
can
always
in
principle
translate
from
"
intentional
talk
"
to
the
fully
predictive
causal
account
of
the
events
in
question
.

But
patience
.

Not
only
are
we
unable
to
prestate
the
configuration
space
of
a
biosphere
and
predict
what
will
unfold
COMMA
but
we
also
can
not
even
translate
—
in
the
sense
of
necessary
and
sucient
conditions
from
legal
talk
to
normal
intentional
talk
COMMA
let
alone
from
legal
talk
of
Henderson
found
guilty
of
murder
to
a
physical
talk
about
sound
-
wave
forms
monitored
and
masses
at
space
-
time
lines
as
a
description
.

Then
let
's
just
be
naive
for
the
moment
.

The
semantics
of
the
yuck
or
yum
coming
into
a
simple
autonomous
agent
say
COMMA
an
early
bacterium
is
somehow
linked
with
the
embodied
know-how
of
that
agent
in
making
a
living
COMMA
or
failing
to
make
a
living
COMMA
in
its
world
.

The
semantics
of
an
event
is
some
subset
of
the
fully
embroidered
COMMA
context
-
dependent
set
of
causal
implications
of
the
event
COMMA
or
signal
COMMA
in
question
.

"
For
want
of
a
nail
COMMA
the
shoe
was
lost
;
for
want
of
the
shoe
COMMA
the
horse
was
lost
;
and
for
want
of
the
horse
COMMA
the
rider
was
lost
COMMA
"
more
or
less
COMMA
said
Benjamin
Franklin
.

The
semantics
of
the
nail
is
some
subset
of
this
embroidered
context
-
dependent
set
of
implications
of
the
event
COMMA
or
signal
COMMA
in
question
to
the
autonomous
agents
in
the
coevolving
system
.

It
seems
hard
to
ascribe
purpose
COMMA
in
the
sense
of
acting
on
its
own
behalf
COMMA
to
a
stone
or
a
chair
and
easy
with
respect
to
an
alga
.

Of
course
COMMA
there
is
a
sense
in
which
my
attribution
of
semantics
to
autonomous
agents
is
purely
tautological
.

After
all
COMMA
I
began
by
stating
that
a
bacterium
swimming
upstream
in
the
glucose
gradient
was
acting
on
its
own
behalf
in
an
environment
COMMA
defined
an
autonomous
agent
as
a
physical
system
able
to
act
on
its
own
behalf
COMMA
then
asked
what
a
physical
system
must
be
such
that
it
can
act
on
its
own
behalf
.

Now
COMMA
five
chapters
later
COMMA
it
is
hardly
an
independent
deduction
that
autonomous
agents
are
the
proposed
organization
of
matter
COMMA
energy
COMMA
and
organization
to
which
purposes
can
be
ascribed
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
act
on
their
own
behalf
.

My
definition
is
a
definitional
circle
.

On
the
other
hand
COMMA
while
the
definition
is
circular
COMMA
like
F
=
MA
and
Darwin
's
"
natural
selection
"
and
"
fitness
COMMA
"
that
does
not
mean
that
the
set
of
codefined
concepts
surrounding
my
definition
of
an
autonomous
agent
as
a
reproducing
system
that
does
a
work
cycle
fails
to
touch
the
real
world
.

Stones
and
chairs
are
not
COMMA
by
my
definition
COMMA
autonomous
agents
.

All
living
cells
are
.

And
the
stunning
fact
directly
before
us
COMMA
every
day
COMMA
is
that
autonomous
agents
do
manipulate
the
world
on
their
own
behalf
.

Watch
a
pair
of
nesting
birds
build
their
nest
.

In
short
COMMA
once
we
have
autonomous
agents
and
yuck
and
yum
COMMA
it
appears
that
semantics
enters
the
universe
as
the
agents
coevolve
and
behave
on
their
own
behalf
with
one
another
in
the
unfolding
of
a
biosphere
.

Knowing

What
about
"
knowing
"
?

Daniel
Dennett
COMMA
in
his
fine
book
Darwin
's
Dangerous
Idea
COMMA
advances
a
hierarchy
of
forms
of
"
knowing
COMMA
"
if
I
may
use
that
term
COMMA
that
have
arisen
in
evolution
by
Darwinian
means
.

I
find
his
hierarchy
congenial
and
informative
.

Dennett
envisions
evolution
as
a
sequence
of
kinds
of
construction
cranes
that
bit
by
bit
build
up
higher
-
order
entities
via
variation
and
natural
selection
.

I
do
not
disagree
COMMA
although
I
have
placed
far
greater
emphasis
on
the
roles
of
self-organization
in
evolution
.

Here
COMMA
in
Investigations
COMMA
I
am
trying
to
point
at
the
mysterious
but
utterly
natural
hopefulness
in
which
an
increasing
diversity
of
broken
symmetries
in
the
universe
creates
the
diversity
of
structures
and
processes
that
can
constitute
and
identify
ramified
and
ramifying
sources
of
energy
COMMA
detect
those
sources
of
energy
COMMA
create
devices
and
processes
that
couple
to
those
sources
of
energy
COMMA
and
generate
yet
more
diversity
that
propagates
macroscopic
order
even
further
.

I
wonder
COMMA
in
short
COMMA
at
the
naturalness
and
self-generaticity
of
Dennett
's
cranes
building
cranes
building
cranes
in
biospheres
COMMA
perhaps
planetary
geologies
COMMA
and
beyond
.

But
back
to
the
past
.

Dennett
distinguishes
"
Darwinian
creatures
COMMA
"
"
Pavlovian
creatures
COMMA
"
"
Popperian
creatures
COMMA
"
and
"
Gregorian
creatures
.
"

A
simple
autonomous
agent
COMMA
say
COMMA
a
bacterium
COMMA
is
a
Darwinian
creature
.

In
its
simplest
version
COMMA
the
creature
evolves
by
mutation
COMMA
also
recombination
and
natural
selection
.

For
the
moment
COMMA
no
behavioral
learning
is
to
be
considered
.

So
one
(
or
a
colony
or
an
ecosystem
)
of
Darwinian
creatures
adapts
more
or
less
as
Darwin
told
us
.

At
the
next
level
up
COMMA
say
COMMA
aplysia
COMMA
a
nervous
system
is
present
COMMA
and
the
creature
is
capable
of
stimulus
-
response
learning
COMMA
à
la
Pavlov
.

Indeed
COMMA
aplysia
can
learn
very
simple
conditioned
stimuli
—
the
later
analogue
is
the
bell
causing
the
dog
to
salivate
in
"
expectation
"
of
food
.

At
the
next
level
(
Dennett
COMMA
perhaps
properly
COMMA
reserves
this
for
us
vertebrates
)
is
the
Popperian
creature
.

Popperian
creatures
COMMA
in
Dennett
's
fine
phrase
COMMA
have
"
internal
models
"
of
their
world
and
can
"
run
the
internal
model
"
with
the
clutch
disengaged
COMMA
rather
than
running
the
model
in
real
time
in
the
real
world
.

This
allows
us
lucky
Popperian
creatures
to
allow
our
"
hypotheses
to
die
in
our
stead
.
"

I
love
that
image
.

Beyond
the
Popperian
is
the
Gregorian
creature
namely
COMMA
at
least
humans
.

Dennett
makes
the
wonderful
argument
that
we
utilize
our
tools
literally
stone
knives
COMMA
arrows
COMMA
digging
sticks
COMMA
machine
tools
to
enlarge
our
shared
world
of
facts
and
processes
.

This
enlarged
shared
world
gives
us
more
know-how
COMMA
and
more
know
that
.

Cultural
evolution
COMMA
at
some
point
COMMA
begins
to
burst
out
-
of
-
bounds
.

Hard
rock
music
jangles
the
minarets
of
Iran
.

Who
knows
what
new
cultural
forms
will
blossom
?

Chinese
cooking
lands
in
Cuba
COMMA
and
Cuban
-
Chinese
cuisine
is
invented
.

What
's
next
under
the
sun
?

Who
can
say
?

I
very
much
like
Dennett
's
ladder
of
know-how
COMMA
and
eventual
know
that
.

Without
invoking
consciousness
COMMA
not
because
it
is
not
worth
invoking
but
because
so
little
sensible
has
ever
been
said
on
the
subject
COMMA
it
seems
worth
asking
how
much
of
this
hierarchy
could
be
realized
by
simple
molecular
systems
COMMA
even
without
evoking
nerve
cells
.

I
would
think
a
lot
of
this
hierarchy
could
find
molecular
realizations
.

For
example
COMMA
bacteria
and
amoebae
do
have
a
kind
of
Pavlovian
learning
already
COMMA
for
they
have
receptors
that
accommodate
to
a
constant
level
of
a
given
signal
ligand
and
sense
instead
a
change
from
the
current
level
.

This
is
not
yet
the
association
of
a
more
or
less
arbitrary
conditioned
stimulus
with
an
unconditioned
stimulus
COMMA
but
I
can
imagine
chemistry
to
accomplish
the
latter
.

As
neurons
are
supposed
to
proliferate
and
form
novel
synaptic
connections
that
survive
if
used
and
to
mediate
the
linkage
of
conditioned
to
unconditioned
stimulus
COMMA
why
not
envision
a
complex
chemistry
COMMA
say
COMMA
very
complex
carbohydrate
-
synthesis
patterns
sustained
by
complex
sets
of
enzymes
whose
activities
are
modulated
by
the
dierent
carbohydrates
themselves
COMMA
which
is
true
of
contemporary
carbohydrate
metabolism
.

Such
a
system
might
blindly
try
out
variant
patterns
of
synthesis
until
it
could
establish
a
self
-
sustaining
web
linking
the
carbohydrates
COMMA
the
enzymes
COMMA
and
certain
protein
receptors
mediating
the
linkage
between
unconditioned
and
conditioned
stimulus
COMMA
then
maintain
that
linkage
by
positive
feedback
loops
.

The
image
is
not
too
far
from
how
it
is
imagined
that
"
idiotype
"
and
"
anti-idiotype
"
immune
networks
work
to
sustain
synthesis
of
a
set
of
desired
antibodies
against
an
incoming
pathogen
.

In
such
networks
COMMA
for
which
there
is
modestly
good
evidence
COMMA
a
given
first
antibody
serves
as
an
antigen
that
stimulates
the
body
to
produce
a
second
antibody
that
binds
to
the
unique
amino
acid
sequences
COMMA
called
the
"
idiotype
"
of
the
first
antibody
.

In
turn
COMMA
the
second
"
anti-idiotype
"
antibody
stimulates
a
third
COMMA
which
stimulates
a
fourth
.

But
this
series
is
likely
to
form
feedback
loops
because
the
first
and
third
antibody
can
often
both
bind
to
the
same
site
on
the
second
antibody
COMMA
hence
COMMA
the
first
and
third
antibodies
are
similar
shapes
in
shape
space
.

It
is
not
much
of
a
stretch
to
think
of
the
immune
system
as
a
conditioned
stimulus
response
system
.

Popperian
creatures
?

Why
can
not
the
molecular-sensing
and
hypothesis-testing
churning
concerns
of
the
bacterium
as
it
senses
a
paramecium
churn
twenty
cycles
before
kicking
in
the
rotary
motor
COMMA
or
not
COMMA
such
that
the
wee
bacterium
hides
under
a
boulder
of
a
grain
of
sand
until
the
beast
passes
by
?

Are
nerves
necessary
?

Plants
COMMA
as
noted
COMMA
are
said
to
signal
one
another
with
complex
secondary
metabolites
to
characterize
the
particular
kinds
of
insects
infesting
the
glade
.

There
are
arbitrary
structural
relations
between
the
metabolite
and
the
insect
COMMA
just
as
symbols
in
human
language
are
often
arbitrary
with
respect
to
the
signified
.

Not
bad
for
nerveless
nonvertebrates
.

I
do
get
stuck
at
Gregorian
creatures
.

Even
here
COMMA
the
free
and
open
creating
of
new
symbol
strings
in
a
language
COMMA
wherever
new
sentences
can
be
created
COMMA
is
not
that
fundamentally
different
from
the
persistent
open
creation
of
new
kinds
of
molecules
in
the
biosphere
as
a
whole
.

If
the
conversation
we
recent
two-legged
ones
are
having
with
respect
to
our
digging
sticks
and
atomic
bombs
is
impressive
COMMA
so
too
is
the
chemical
conversation
in
any
full
-
fledged
ecosystem
COMMA
where
we
are
all
instrumental
in
the
lives
of
one
another
.

I
suppose
I
am
naively
driven
to
consider
that
the
biosphere
COMMA
with
its
urgent
diversity
in
which
COMMA
emboldened
by
all
our
know-how
COMMA
we
do
get
on
with
a
very
rich
conversation
COMMA
may
very
early
already
have
harbored
all
the
levels
of
which
Dennett
speaks
.

We
humans
are
just
more
gregarious
with
our
vocal
cords
and
e-mail
COMMA
I
guess
.

Smart
place
COMMA
a
biosphere
COMMA
lots
to
talk
about
.

Four
billion

yammering

Slapstick

Ethics

And
what
of
ethics
?

Does
a
whiff
of
ethical
issue
arise
with
autonomous
agents
?

Yuck
or
yum
from
my
point
of
view
if
I
am
an
autonomous
agent
.

There
are
deep
reasons
for
caution
.

Hume
told
us
long
ago
about
the
"
naturalistic
fallacy
"
:
One
can
not
deduce
"
ought
"
from
"
is
.
"

From
the
fact
that
mothers
care
for
their
young
COMMA
we
can
not
deduce
that
they
ought
to
do
so
COMMA
Hume
argued
.

From
the
fact
that
Hitler
set
out
to
conquer
Europe
and
more
and
to
kill
Jewry
COMMA
we
can
not
deduce
that
he
ought
to
have
done
so
.

Indeed
COMMA
Hume
's
injunction
underlies
the
caution
of
scientists
about
making
ethical
statements
.

We
scientists
find
the
facts
.

You
citizens
across
the
globe
can
argue
the
ethics
.

But
if
Hume
warns
us
not
to
deduce
ought
from
is
COMMA
where
do
values
come
from
at
all
?

Hume
's
injunction
against
deduction
from
is
to
ought
nevertheless
began
by
recognizing
the
legitimacy
of
the
category
"
ought
.
"

The
efforts
following
Hume
to
understand
the
meaning
of
ethical
assertions
have
been
long
COMMA
twisted
COMMA
arduous
.

Following
the
dictates
of
the
logical
positivists
of
the
Vienna
Circle
that
only
those
statements
capable
of
verification
were
meaningful
COMMA
philosophers
as
famous
as
G.E.
Moore
came
to
wonder
if
ethical
assertions
were
merely
emotive
utterances
.

"
It
is
wrong
to
kill
.
"

Becomes
COMMA
"
Agggah
!
"

Does
the
positivist
argument
seem
persuasive
?

It
has
always
amused
me
that
the
core
injunction
of
the
logical
positivists
COMMA
"
only
those
statements
that
are
empirically
verifiable
are
meaningful
COMMA
"
is
itself
not
empirically
verifiable
.

One
is
reminded
of
something
about
hoisting
and
petards
.

John
Rawls
of
Harvard
has
argued
eloquently
that
our
human
notions
of
fairness
derive
from
what
we
would
all
"
contractually
"
agree
to
COMMA
were
we
to
know
before
birth
that
we
would
all
be
born
with
differing
abilities
and
endowments
.

Thus
"
equality
before
the
law
"
is
one
contract
that
Rawls
commends
to
us
.

"
Equality
before
the
law
"
is
far
more
refined
than
the
yuck
or
yum
of
the
bacterium
.

The
emergence
of
ethics
in
the
evolution
of
life
on
this
planet
is
a
fascinating
issue
.

I
will
content
myself
with
wondering
where
"
value
"
and
the
rudiments
of
"
intentionality
"
come
from
in
the
physical
universe
in
the
first
place
and
leave
social
contracts
for
other
efforts
.

Where
is
the
place
of
value
in
a
world
of
fact
?

So
COMMA
a
short
soliloquy
.

Facts
are
know-that
statements
.

But
know-how
preceded
know
that
.

While
fully
aware
of
Hume
's
injunction
COMMA
I
think
that
from
the
autonomous
agent
's
perspective
COMMA
yuck
or
yum
is
primary
COMMA
unavoidable
COMMA
and
of
the
deepest
importance
to
that
agent
.

I
suppose
we
apply
the
Darwinian
criteria
.

Too
much
yuck
COMMA
this
one
and
its
progeny
are
gone
from
the
future
of
the
biosphere
.

Without
attributing
consciousness
to
an
E.
coli
COMMA
or
an
autonomous
agent
we
may
create
in
the
near
future
COMMA
I
can
not
help
but
feel
that
the
rudiments
of
value
are
present
once
autonomous
agents
are
around
.

And
again
without
attributing
consciousness
COMMA
once
an
autonomous
agent
is
around
is
the
rudiment
of
intentionality
present
?

If
so
COMMA
another
cornerstone
of
ethical
activity
has
been
laid
.

Ethical
behavior
requires
first
the
logical
possibility
of
behavior
for
which
one
is
responsible
.

You
are
not
responsible
for
acts
and
effects
beyond
your
control
.

To
act
ethically
COMMA
you
must
first
be
able
to
act
at
all
.

But
what
are
"
acts
"
in
the
first
place
?

Daniel
Yamins
is
a
brilliant
young
mathematician
.

Now
entering
Harvard
COMMA
Dan
spent
a
summer
with
me
at
the
Santa
Fe
Institute
before
he
learned
to
drive
COMMA
after
an
earlier
summer
spent
in
the
laboratory
of
Jack
Szostak
at
Harvard
COMMA
where
COMMA
at
age
fourteen
COMMA
Dan
was
learning
to
evolve
RNA
molecules
to
bind
arbitrary
ligands
.

Dan
and
I
struggled
that
summer
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
"
doings
"
of
an
autonomous
agent
and
mere
happenings
in
and
around
the
autonomous
agent
.

Note
we
say
the
E.
coli
is
swimming
upstream
in
the
glucose
gradient
to
get
dinner
.

But
all
sorts
of
molecular
vibrational
COMMA
rotational
COMMA
and
translational
motions
are
occurring
.

What
are
actions
and
what
are
mere
happenings
?

I
do
not
think
we
were
successful
in
drawing
a
clean
distinction
between
doings
and
happenings
with
clear
mathematics
.

But
I
sense
that
the
distinction
between
doings
and
happenings
COMMA
Dan
's
happy
phrasing
COMMA
is
relevant
for
E.
coli
COMMA
tigers
COMMA
us
COMMA
trees
COMMA
and
autonomous
agents
in
general
.

We
will
meet
a
similar
problem
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
attempt
to
distinguish
between
the
function
of
a
part
of
an
organism
and
the
other
causal
consequences
of
that
part
of
the
organism
.

Strange
and
interesting
COMMA
is
it
not
COMMA
that
these
issues
all
seem
to
arise
with
autonomous
agents
but
not
otherwise
?

Granted
that
we
here
seem
to
confront
the
language
game
circularity
alluded
to
earlier
COMMA
yet
I
do
truly
think
that
the
rudiments
of
semantics
COMMA
intentionality
COMMA
value
COMMA
and
ethics
arise
with
autonomous
agents
.

I
do
not
think
those
rudiments
suffice
to
jump
over
Hume
's
naturalistic
fallacy
.

We
can
not
deduce
ought
from
is
in
any
concrete
context
COMMA
but
I
think
we
have
the
categories
of
ought
and
is
in
the
physical
universe
once
we
have
autonomous
agents
.
